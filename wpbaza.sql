feature Sunita Rai, a content marketer originally from a remote village in the hills of Nepal. Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1536%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible. By participating, you will better understand the project and its people, so you can advocate WordPress in a better way. It will offer you a sense of satisfaction or meaning as well as success in your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these open source contributor stories and grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>, or continue your own WordPress journey at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sunitarai/\">Sunita Rai&nbsp;</a>for sharing about her adventures in WordPress, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Abha Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nalini Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webtechpooja/\">Pooja Derashri,</a> <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meher Bala</a>, <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicholas Garofalo</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chloe Bringmann</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\">Maja Loncar</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary Baum</a> for interviews, editorial, images, and reviews.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser or specifically for this one; if you liked what you heard, share it with a fellow collaborator whether they know WordPress or not. But if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at wpbriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. <br><br>[00:08:10] (Music outro)</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"16810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WordPress 6.4.3 – Maintenance and Security release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/wordpress-6-4-3-maintenance-and-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Jan 2024 21:22:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:346:\"This security and maintenance release features 5 bug fixes on Core, 16 bug fixes for the Block Editor, and 2 security fixes.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, we&#8217;ve got a throwback episode about blogging. If you&#8217;re like me, you sometimes miss the early days of blogs, where the words were a little more pensive, and the images were a little less professional. If you&#8217;re on a slow hobby journey like so many of us are right now, give this one a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:58] (music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning. You may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their own project or business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool. We have long since outgrown that, but even 20 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because, even after those 20 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same, and that is to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help people have a place online where they can tell their stories, or share their projects, or set up their businesses. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So, I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, Oh, Jospeha, how old fashioned. I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website. And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first-ever website. So let&#8217;s dive in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So, have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, but also some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first, cause like, if you want the domain name WordPress.org, like, we own that, you can&#8217;t have that. But if you know that you want a domain like &#8216;WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com&#8217; like, that one might be more available. And if you know kind of the words you want in your domain, then you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mention all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it&#8217;s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start before you even know what WordPress is most of the time. So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is, what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date. There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service, where they will keep your WordPress software up to date and provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So it ranges all the way from full service like that, all the way down to essentially zero service, just kind of hands off. They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site, but they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you; they leave updating up to you, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself and the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software, and what you want, and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either services with the existing host that you chose or moving to a different host; however, that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually, most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click, and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, on the other side of that spectrum, that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server, or you know how to work in this thing called cPanel, etc. So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to WordPress.org/download and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment. Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little, I&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the LearnWP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host, as well as various other early steps of this process. If you felt like I blazed through all of that, which, honestly, I kind of did. You can work through those lessons in that course at your own pace, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this &#8216;Hello World&#8217; post. There&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare, like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMSs in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh. We&#8217;ve got now a website. We know kind of how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can be moderated, and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some choose-your-own-adventure guiding questions here. Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words? Mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want, three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to WordPress.org/themes and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to WordPress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically, so that you can see how things look right away. And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site, so if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely. And just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every WordPress instance ships with a theme, and it is fully functional when you get your site up and running, so you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready. And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites, is to add plugins to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality to it. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions? If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there. If that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find. And as a general side note here as well, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine. I&#8217;ll tell you this, I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms, and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So, yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the one hand, you definitely can. And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem and, obviously, hear some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Josepha</strong>: Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for for years, but also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009, and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy. We are the easiest of the hard options for CMSs like content management systems are just complicated. But we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game like you should have had a website for years, I mean, sure, that could be true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time to plant that tree is today. WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now, our small list of big things. Today we&#8217;ve got some look-back items and some look-forward items. So let&#8217;s hop right in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing is we have a year in review with the themes team. So much amazing work has been done by the themes team over the past year, both for reviewing themes and creating them. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to those in the show notes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a post out that just has some general celebrations from teams around the community. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that. It probably has been linked in quite a few places, but you know, we don&#8217;t always embrace those moments of celebration. We don&#8217;t always embrace our wins. And so it&#8217;s always good to share those early and often. There are probably more than just those two. So if you posted one or you saw a really interesting one that you think that we should know about, don&#8217;t forget to share it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Next, we have a leap into 2024 with Site Editor tools. So, on the new Developer Blog, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, there is a lot of excellent content there for whether you are like an advanced developer in WordPress or you&#8217;re kind of intermediate and ready to move into your advanced developer era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor will give you a powerful way to visually create every part of your site and tell your story. And this post will help you to kind of see how to handle everything from big style changes to simple copy updates, all in a single place. We want to make sure that you get the most out of your WordPress this year. And that post will give you a few standout tools and features that you&#8217;ll want to try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to keep an eye out for updates as we move into 2024 around team reps. So each team in the WordPress project goes through a process to review and elect team reps, and elections are happening now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Along with things that are happening now that you should keep an eye on, the annual goals, our big picture post has gone out as well. It went out at the end of the week last week. There&#8217;ll be a link to all of these in the show notes. And yeah, keep an eye out for, hopefully, a fantastic 2024 in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

That’s why I announced a new initiative called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Data Liberation</a> for 2024. Migrating your site to WordPress, or exporting all your content from WordPress, should be possible in one click. I want WordPress’ export format to become the lingua franca of CMSes, whether coming to WordPress or moving within WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often hear about folks across the WordPress community duplicating efforts when creating scripts and workflows to move users to WordPress. Imagine if we shared those resources instead and built community-owned plugins that anyone could use! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it should be more than plugins; workflows, tutorials, and helper scripts should be shared, too. I want this resource to have space to include moving from social networks, moving from a page builder to core blocks, switching from classic to blocks, and improving WordPress current canonical plugins for importing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You can help!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the heart of any open source project is the community that shows up to build it. My hope is that this marks the start of a new contribution pathway, separate from core teams, that allows folks to contribute what they’ve learned and what they’ve created to help others move to WordPress. I expect this emphasis on migration will also influence future development, both in core and with recommended community or canonical plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that I think will be key to making this project a success:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A dedicated landing page on WordPress.org following a WordPress.org/and/[platform-name] format.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A forum used for non-review user feedback and general discussion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A dedicated Slack channel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderation within hours rather than days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listed on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress\">WordPress GitHub</a> with syncing for individual commits to SVN for history in both places.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By complementing the community’s existing efforts—the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future program</a>, the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress initiative</a>, a focus on internationalization, etc.—my hope is that this will help even more people see themselves in the WordPress project, providing fresh momentum for <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/\">WordCamps and meetups</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s never been more crucial to champion openness on the web. Bringing focused attention to improved portability will untether users and increase their freedom like never before.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"16736\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WP Briefing: Episode 70: A Look Ahead at WordPress in 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/episode-70-a-look-ahead-at-wordpress-in-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=16677\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:264:\"Curious about WordPress\'s big-picture items for 2024?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hello, my dears, and welcome to 2024. I hope you&#8217;ve had a lovely break. At the top of the year, I like to look around and gather the projects that the community is interested in. We can&#8217;t always commit to everything, and sometimes even the things we plan to do can&#8217;t make it across the finish line. In the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be publishing kind of the big picture goals for the year, but I wanted to share a little bit about what I&#8217;ve collected so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Firstly, we&#8217;ve got Phase 3. This has been called a few things over the years: collaborative editing, multiplayer, co-editing. But whatever it&#8217;s been called, the biggest changes to writing and design workflows are likely to happen in this phase. A redesigned workflow can be a bit of a shock. But fortunately, we already have a prototype out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll include a link to some resources in the show notes, or of course, you can always stop by make.WordPress.org/core for some insights. But I would encourage you to, at the very least, get your hands on that prototype to see what it looks like is coming in Phase 3 so that you can be aware and provide your feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing on our list is Data Liberation. This is a new-to-us project that was introduced at State of the Word. Fortunately, though, it&#8217;s not a new concept overall. Data Liberation is actually one of the earliest ideas that sold me on WordPress. The idea that you could set up a site for a client, or yourself, and that hard work wasn&#8217;t lost if something went wrong, was really important to me. It&#8217;s been a long time since we put any effort into our importers and exporters, and I think this will be a good focus for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I&#8217;ve picked up, kind of a list of three things, but there are three mid-sized areas that I want us to pay attention to this year: plugins, old tickets, and new meetups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins, because they really have turned a corner on where they ended 2023. A lot of work has been done to make sure that they&#8217;ve streamlined some efforts, gotten some better onboarding for folks as they&#8217;re going in, and we could really use a hand to keep that momentum going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Old tickets, because it&#8217;s something that we hope for year after year when we&#8217;re talking to people about what they want in new releases. So often, part of what they say is some way to work through all of these old things that have been around forever, some with patches. And why not, after all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then new meetups, because I really still think that meetups are the best intro to WordPress. No matter whether you&#8217;re wanting to become a developer eventually or, like, the community-building aspect is the thing that hooks you forever. Meetups are the place to encourage those and discover those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing on my list is also two things. It&#8217;s two things, but kind of a guess at the moment. There are two summit items that I want us to try to consider this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one is contributor recognition. Acknowledgment and recognition, I think, are two different things, and there was an entire series of sessions at the summit where we talked about it. And so I think that it&#8217;s worth us digging in on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing from the summit that I would really like us to all kind of dig in on is accessibility, how we do it, how we confirm it, what we think we should do versus what we actually do, and see what we can move on the needle there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing is sort of a personal wish. I think it&#8217;s about time that we take a look at the way that we kind of manage ourselves as a project, the way that we do our meetings and report on our successes, things like that. And I realize that this is a big thing, and it might be a little bit scary. But, I mean, we&#8217;ve been doing this for a really long time, and it&#8217;s probably as good a time as any, frankly, to look at what we&#8217;re doing by habit or tradition and see if it still suits us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s my back of the napkin set of notes so far. Keep an eye out in the next couple of weeks for the annual Big Picture post so you can get some context, notes, and discussion opportunities. And, of course, anything that has shown up that&#8217;s a bit bigger, a bit more final will be in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, our small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:52] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Firstly, State of the Word had nearly 200 questions submitted, and Matt has been answering the overflow on make.WordPress.org/project. So, I&#8217;ll include a link, but head on over there to that post if you would like to catch up on those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second item, and last item, is that you&#8217;ve got a few more days left to give us feedback on WordPress meetups in 2023, and give us an idea of what we can do to improve those. I believe those close on January 14th. I really love my local meetup, and I hope that we can get some of that same sort of feeling going in all of yours, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

It lets you handle everything from big stylistic changes to simple copy updates all in a single place. To help you make the most of this new way to WordPress, here are a few standout tools and features you’ll want to try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Command Palette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of the Command Palette as the ultimate shortcut tool, letting you do more with less clicks and without needing to remember where each option might be. It’s available across the editing experience, whether you’re switching between templates in the Site Editor or toggling open settings in the Post Editor, with specific contextual options depending on where you are.<strong> </strong>You can use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+K on Mac or Ctrl+K on Windows to activate it and get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think of a command that doesn’t exist yet that would help with your workflow, open a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new/choose\">feature request issue</a> so we can consider adding it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/12/Command-Palette-news-post.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-default\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/12/core-editor-improvement-commanding-the-command-palette/\"><em>Read more</em></a><em> about everything you can do with the Command Palette, including a </em><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-command-palette/#list-of-available-commands\"><em>list of available commands</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Style Book</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book helps you see all the blocks on your site as you style them. It’s built into the Styles section and can be toggled on/off as you’d like. This is especially useful when you’re aiming for design consistency for a client, trying to see how a change might impact a block that might not be visible, or wanting to get a different look at how a style variation will switch things up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work is also underway for the next WordPress release to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56800\">integrate the Style Book into Style revisions</a> to allow for an at-a-glance view of changes made. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/12/Style-book-news-post-demo.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/how-to-use-the-wordpress-stylebook-with-your-block-theme/\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about how best to use the Style Book.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Styling shortcuts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you get a design just right—the color contrast, the perfect padding, the exact font size. Instead of needing to manually recreate the design or copy/paste the block to fill in with new content, you have two powerful options built into the editing experience: copy/paste styles and apply styles globally for all instances of the desired block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copying and pasting styles is perfect for more nuanced and smaller changes, like headings on a landing page that you intentionally want to be distinct. Applying changes globally is best for blocks like buttons and for changes that are likely to work well across layouts, like setting a specific border radius and color. This helps keep the creativity flowing and makes achieving design consistency across your site much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/12/Styling-options-news-post-demo.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/02/01/core-editor-improvement-strengthening-style-options/\"><em>Read more</em></a><em> about the various styling options available.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Distraction free mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like an artist might need to take a few steps back to view their in-progress artwork, sometimes we need to get a different view of our site before diving back in. Distraction free offers you that alternate perspective with a pared-down experience that lets you focus purely on creating, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hiding the top toolbar until one intentionally hovers over where it typically sits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removing many of the top toolbar buttons.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatically closing any open sidebars, like block settings and list view.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hiding the insertion point indicator, reducing visual clutter.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hiding the block toolbar for individual blocks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that this mode can be used when writing posts and pages too! For an added bonus and more views of your site, you can use the preview options to see how your site might look across different devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/12/Distraction-free-and-preview-news-post-demo.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/distraction-free-mode/\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about making the most out of Distraction free mode.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are a collection of blocks that make it simple to add complex layouts and designs to any WordPress site without starting from scratch. They save time by reducing duplication and ensuring consistency. You can create your own, use theme-provided patterns, or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">lean on the Pattern Directory</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also specify whether to sync your patterns so that one change applies to all parts of your site, or to keep them unsynced so you can customize each instance. For any patterns you create, you can assign categories to make them easy to find and organize. Use the Inserter with easy filtering options to add patterns to your content, and head to the dedicated Patterns section in the Site Editor to create or edit patterns to your liking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/12/Patterns-news-post-demo.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/creating-your-own-custom-synced-or-non-synced-patterns/\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about creating patterns.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>List View is the go-to tool for navigating between layers of your content, selecting exactly what you need, and getting a sense of how everything fits together. Similar to the Style Book and Distraction free mode, you can toggle it on/off as you’d like. It’s currently visible in the Top Toolbar and will remain open as you navigate through your site. Beyond providing a simple view of the layers of your site, there are more recent additions to List View that makes the tool even more powerful:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>See previews of your images for Image and Gallery blocks reflected in List View to make it easier to find what you need.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Escape key deselects blocks to make it easier to purely preview your content without any blocks selected.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lean on a keyboard shortcut for duplicating blocks quickly: CMD+Shift+D for Mac or Control + Shift + D for Windows.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drag and drop blocks at any level directly within List View.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rename Group blocks and have the custom name reflected in List View for improved organization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how a few of these improvements come together:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/12/List-View-news-post-demo.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about using List View. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As you explore these tools, remember that, except for the Style Book, you can use these features when writing posts and pages too. Expect the Site Editor and other tools to evolve with each release.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> We wrapped up State of the Word earlier this month, and while I was sitting there being the only person to clap for the love of cake, I realized just how much we have been able to accomplish this year. And on the one hand, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, progress is radical over time yet incremental in time. But all told, 2023 has been a big year for WordPress. There&#8217;s been some radical progress in a few places. There are the things you know because you&#8217;ve heard them all year. You heard them in State of the Word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We turned 20, for instance. We shipped three on-time releases. We had three well-organized flagship events, and we prototyped essential parts of phase 3. But there&#8217;s a lot of work that happens outside of flagship events and software releases, and I&#8217;d like to highlight a few examples of operational excellence in our community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:31] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First highlight goes to the contributors who are building community. Going back to 2021, we&#8217;ve been working to bring people back together in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in that year, we had 19 events. In 2022, we had 24 events, so a modest increase of just over 30%. But then, in 2023, the WordPress community banded together on a campaign to reignite passion in our Meetup groups and encourage playfulness in our WordCamp planning. And not only did we see a 57% increase in active Meetup groups, But we also saw a 116% increase in WordCamps, 54 WordCamps in all. That&#8217;s about a third of the way to our all-time annual high of 142.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to complement these in-person opportunities, Learn also shipped 104 pieces of new content and hosted 258 online workshops because location should never be a barrier to entry for joining WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second highlight goes to the contributors who are managing our directories. We do have a lot of directories. We have Plugins, Themes, Photos, Block plugins. We got a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m sure that everyone saw the consistent and borderline pleading calls to join the Plugin team this year. And for folks who&#8217;ve been around a bit, you probably recall a similar set of consistent and pleading calls to join the Theme team a few years back. Concurrent with the work to refill that contribution pipeline, folks over in Meta and across the project generally, were working on automating as many checks as possible, loosening guidelines where it was reasonable, and modernizing as many processes as we could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to share that the theme wait time is at a historic low, with their longest wait sometimes just at a week. And as anxious as I am about the plugin wait times, we&#8217;re actually seeing a lot of progress there as well. As we follow a process similar to the one that we did on themes, I imagine it&#8217;s only gonna get better. So, in 2023, we&#8217;ve onboarded six new team members. And since September, the number of plugins awaiting initial review has been cut in half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then coming up in Q1 of 2024, we&#8217;ll have a project focused entirely on automating as many checks as possible. So I still need you, but I also need you to know that your work there matters and is having an impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third highlight goes to the contributors who are doing outreach. This year, we launched a mentorship program with an 89% completion rate because we&#8217;ve seen time and again that our most prolific contributors had someone at the start that they felt safe asking dumb questions with. We launched and nurtured the developer blog, which was a need identified by the community because there was no place for intermediate and advanced developers to get excited about their cool explorations. And there were 53 posts there this year with thirteen thousand views, which is a 251% increase for the record, which is a ridiculous increase, but it&#8217;s a lot. Thirteen thousand views is a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have focused on documentation as we suggested in Porto of 2022. And marketing, I know not always our favorite topic, but marketing, our ability to talk about ourselves to more than just ourselves, has increased dramatically this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only have we started rolling out a modern design across our website, but we also are present and engaged on eight different platforms with 20-plus episodes of this very podcast and also video content that netted us seven and a half million views this year. That&#8217;s a lot of numbers, and there&#8217;s a post that goes with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Check out the show notes. But if you&#8217;re not gonna check out the show notes because you listen to this on Pocket Casts or Google or something, go to make.WordPress.org/project, and it&#8217;ll be over there. But the point is, it&#8217;s been a banner year for the software, and I am grateful for every tester, designer, and developer that showed up for it. But I also know that what makes WordPress truly irreplaceable is our ecosystem, and it&#8217;s contributions like this and the contributors who do them that make our ecosystem vibrant and responsive and thriving on into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, thank you all for the contributions you make to WordPress. Thank you for the shining example of how to do open source at scale, and thank you for another great year together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things. It is indeed a small this time. First up, I would like to introduce our enhanced content safety features on Openverse. By default, search results now exclude openly licensed media containing sensitive textual content. But this new feature adds additional filtering based on titles, tags, and descriptions of the work as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on our small list of big things is that there is just a general alert. There&#8217;s a WordPress security team impersonation scam that&#8217;s going on out there. The team is aware of multiple ongoing phishing scams impersonating both the WordPress team and the WordPress security team in an attempt to convince administrators to install a plugin on their website which contains malware. I&#8217;ll include a link to that post just in case you have anyone that you think might need to be aware of that, but also all of our site administrators know. Like, WordPress is not gonna email you asking for passwords or anything ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number three, I would like you to join the Plugin review team. I know I just said it in the body of the episode. But, the Plugin review team is looking for new members still who believe in our mission of guiding plugin authors in responsibly transforming their innovative ideas into reality and ensuring a great WordPress plugin experience for end users. There is a deadline to apply; it&#8217;s December 31st. And so you can get that done over the holidays, over a glass of eggnog if that&#8217;s how you choose to celebrate whatever it is that you do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s it for your small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser.

Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible. By participating, you will better understand the project and its people, so you can advocate WordPress in a better way. It will offer you a sense of satisfaction or meaning as well as success in your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these open source contributor stories and grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>, or continue your own WordPress journey at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sunitarai/\">Sunita Rai&nbsp;</a>for sharing about her adventures in WordPress, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Abha Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nalini Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webtechpooja/\">Pooja Derashri,</a> <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meher Bala</a>, <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicholas Garofalo</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chloe Bringmann</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\">Maja Loncar</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary Baum</a> for interviews, editorial, images, and reviews.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

Meanwhile, Gutenberg 17.6 has been released and 17.7 is in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my explorations, I used WordPress Playground with the lasted Gutenberg Nightly. <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">You are invited to follow along.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About the feature, quoted from McCarthy&#8217;s post: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Building upon the power of synced patterns, pattern overrides allows you to ensure a synced layout and style across patterns while enabling each instance of the pattern to have customized content. This provides consistency in design across different pieces of content. (&#8230;) Additionally, folks would then be able to revisit and modify the design of the recipe pattern without affecting the content in existing instances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series of videos, you&#8217;ll see me creating a pattern from the theme&#8217;s patterns, set the allowed overrides for content parts of the pattern, here heading block, button block und Image block</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I change a few styles of the pattern to make it my own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On three new pages, I use the pattern, change the headline, button text and link and and replace the image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In part three, I change the original synced pattern some more, and the changes are then immediately applied to the copies on those three pages as well.

One at a time. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For this first version, the feature for WordPress 6.5, only Heading, Paragraph, Image, and Buttons block allow overrides. The pattern, however, has a List block section that won&#8217;t be part of the overrides.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"272\" height=\"87\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-12.37.18.png?resize=272%2C87&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27288\" />\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This part is new and still a little hidden. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Select the block, </li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the sidebar, scroll all the way down to <code>Advanced > Pattern Overrides</code> section and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the checkbox next to &#8220;Allow instance overrides&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To continue with my test, I also changed the background for the pattern, the font for the headline &#8220;Inter&#8221;, increased the button, changed its background and added more radius. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-12.43.16.png?resize=652%2C255&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27283\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It now looks quite different from the theme&#8217;s pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"part-2-use-the-pattern-with-overrides-on-various-pages\">Part 2: Use the pattern with overrides on various pages. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that&#8217;s a sync pattern with overrides, I can use it on any page with different headline, button text and image. That&#8217;s part 2 of the exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When using a synced pattern with overrides, the content pieces that can change will have a small light blue outline, as illustrated in below graphic. Notice the list block doesn&#8217;t have a blue outline, as it&#8217;s not part of the overrides settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-07-at-11.29.34.png?resize=652%2C325&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27313\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"part-3-edit-the-original-again-and-see-changes-propagated\">Part 3: Edit the original again and see changes propagated</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to change the button color again, make the button smaller and reduce the border radius of the image and change the background to a solid color instead of the gradient.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img width=\"368\" height=\"79\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-07-at-19.18.09.png?resize=368%2C79&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27324\" /></div>\n\n\n<p>You can follow long via this video, first you see the changes I made to the original pattern, and then you can see that those are immediately applied to the other instances without changing the content. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A partial sync pattern is achieved by assigning content blocks to be edited.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-look-behind-the-scene-of-the-pattern-block-markup\">A look behind the scene of the pattern block markup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Original Pattern mark up with overrides has added block attributes <code>metadata</code>.

I probably can&#8217;t as it has its lock mechanism.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What would a theme developer have to do to create patterns that allow content overrides and update when the theme updates? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I lock down the overrides for content creators?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the info section of the Pattern list, it still shows &#8220;Fully synced&#8221; (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58725\">#58725</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I didn&#8217;t succeed in changing the text of the button after I already changed the link. I only succeeded when I first changed the button text and then the link. Need to do some more testing. If the toolbar is on top, there is no problem, only when the toolbar is just above the block.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thank you to Anne McCarthy post review. </li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 18:36:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: #109 – Ben Ritner on How Kadence WP Managed the Pivot Towards AI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=153732\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/109-ben-ritner-on-how-kadence-wp-managed-the-pivot-towards-ai\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61665:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how one company managed to pivot towards AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Ben Ritner. Ben is the founder of Kadence WP, a company that specializes in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021, Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand. Where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there&#8217;s a suite of popular plugins, including Learn Dash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact that it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI generated content and images. Ben&#8217;s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started right through to today, where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow. AI is still new, and it&#8217;s possible that what&#8217;s all the rage today will be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ben Ritner. Hello, Ben.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Hey. Nice to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you for joining me today. We&#8217;re going to talk today about AI. We&#8217;re also going to talk about Ben&#8217;s history with WordPress and Kadence, which is a product that Ben launched quite a little while ago, but he can tell you all about that. But first, Ben, just so that the audience know who you are, and what your relationship is with WordPress, a moment to give us your potted bio, if that&#8217;s all right. So over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. So I&#8217;m the founder of Kadence WP, which is a company that develops themes and plugins for WordPress, primarily focused on the front end of your website. So, how do you make that website look good, responsive, fast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re, you know, kind of in that page builder space, but we&#8217;re doing it from a blocks perspective. So we&#8217;ve got a package of blocks, that enable you to do a lot more with the core Gutenberg editor, than what comes in core. And at this moment, I&#8217;m part of the senior leadership team of StellarWP, which is a umbrella brand that Kadence is under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence was acquired in 2021. And so now I&#8217;ve moved in with the Stellar org, and we have a number of popular plugins in our suite, including LearnDash, and the events calendar GiveWP. So, yeah, that&#8217;s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, great. Thank you so much. We are going to dwell a little bit on AI. In fact, I think the primary focus of this will be to touch on AI, but we&#8217;re going to come at it from different angles. We&#8217;ll talk about the products that you&#8217;ve got, although that may not be the primary focus of what we talk about. But we&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about ethics maybe, or, you know, how AI works, and how it might affect the job market, and whether we&#8217;re doing ourselves out of work in the future, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the first questions I&#8217;ve got for you is surrounding the software that you build. Now, you can go into the details of it if you wish, that&#8217;s absolutely fine. Get into the weeds, and get all technical. I&#8217;m going to encourage users to go to the following url. So it&#8217;s kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai. If you want to find that in an easier way, go to WP Tavern, search for this episode, and it&#8217;ll be in the show notes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But over there you demonstrate how you can create, more or less an entire website. So completely from scratch. You&#8217;ve got a vanilla install of WordPress, you install all the bits and pieces that Kadence requires, and moments later, and I really do mean moments. I think you could probably achieve this in under three, four minutes. You&#8217;ve got yourself a functioning website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m interested to know, why you went down that route? What were the sort of, the things that you were thinking about? Why website building? Why not, oh I don&#8217;t know, just simply block building? I&#8217;m curious to know where you are getting your inspiration from. Because if we rewind the clock two years, nobody was talking about AI in the WordPress space, and those that were, were very prescient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody&#8217;s talking about it. There&#8217;s this landslide of products. And you must feel the commercial pressure to get these things right. So, how do you know? How do you judge that what you are building is the right thing for the company&#8217;s future? As opposed to just, well, guesswork really. Difficult question, but let&#8217;s begin there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So I think with Kadence, the decision making comes down to, we were really listening to our user base. And we had a product, we have a product called Kadence Starter Templates. Which is essentially a site that is designed, and has placeholder text, and allows you to import that as you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m going tolaunch a site quickly. Maybe it&#8217;s in my correct niche, because we had over 80 starter templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe the images are close to something I&#8217;m going to do, or maybe the text is close. But I&#8217;ve got to go in there and edit it, and make it my own. That starting place gets past that white screen of, what do I do, I&#8217;m staring at a white screen, and somehow I need to build a website from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was immensely popular. We saw all kinds of users using it, from the agencies using it as a, I want to get started quickly on a site, that they had already had designed for, but they wanted to use the starter template because they just wanted it to be built out to where they could edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we saw, you know, freelancers using it. We saw hobbyists using it. And essentially, when we went in to look at, what&#8217;s the easiest way to implement AI, to make that faster and better for users? How do we make that white screen problem of, I don&#8217;t know what to do next, easier for users? And there&#8217;s a lot of focus right now on prompt based communication with the AI, where it&#8217;s really on, how good are you at writing a prompt to an AI to get stuff back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we kind of just wanted to approach, can we take our starter templates product, and just make the content, the images, and the text, be filled with AI data? Images, we&#8217;re still a ways out from, because AI generated images are pretty poor at this time, and expensive. What we do use, is we use AI to search Pexels, and then pull in images that are in that same vein for what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good starting point, but is it a launch site? No. Like, there&#8217;s nothing about our product, or even where we&#8217;re trying to go, where we&#8217;ll say, you can launch and don&#8217;t need to edit. Part of it is because AI is not that good. But there is a sense of, are you 80% there? And that, I think, is really intriguing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, in our minds, this was step one. Ideally we can get to 90% there. Because I think once AI images gets better, and being able to tell the AI specifically, hey, we&#8217;ve got a hero here, there&#8217;s this text , we want an image for that background, you know, we will get there eventually. But as far as like our decision making into what are we going to build, it really came out of, what are people using and like, and how do we make that experience better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you were in the, well, lucky isn&#8217;t the right word, but you&#8217;re in the enviable position, that you already had the stack of things that really were required. And it was just a case, well, just a case, it was a case of tweaking the things that you already had. So the starter templates, and what have you. And that&#8217;s the decision that you made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s curious, because I&#8217;ve seen quite a lot of commercial products come out of nowhere, and they&#8217;re trying to do exactly the same thing. So in a sense, you had a lot of that stack in place, which must have made it, well, again, I don&#8217;t mean to use the word easy, but it must have made it slightly easier for you to build on top of what you already had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. It definitely made it, it made the story easy to tell. Because I think that&#8217;s part of the issue when you&#8217;re talking about AI is, how do you explain this to your users in a way where you can show them how this is going to benefit, and make their lives easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were also like, we know the problems that come with the current way that we were doing starter templates. Which was essentially, we have a dummy site that actually lives on a server somewhere, and you&#8217;re just copying that to your local site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had thought about, what if we broke this down to be a section by section thing? Where we don&#8217;t actually have a dummy site that lives somewhere. What we have is a library of sections, that can go throughout any kind of pages, and then we&#8217;ll live on your site, put those sections together with content, to build out the pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we took the idea of starter templates and just said, let&#8217;s rechange the technology behind it, so it&#8217;s better and more flexible, and then add in AI generated content and images that can be changed on the fly, and are specific to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have some other AI tools built in. What&#8217;s interesting is, you know, we started with, can we get starter templates, and then we backed off. But what we need to do is figure out the sections piece. How do we get AI into sections, and then we pulled that back out to like, okay, now we can do pages and then websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really interesting to think through where we can go with AI. And I think what your original question was getting at is, how do you choose where to go? And we had a path of like, here&#8217;s an easy story, and here&#8217;s how we can implement it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I think about, where is AI going, what&#8217;s the future, what&#8217;s it going to look like? AI, to me, is a very good tool at doing iterative work. When you ask an AI to improve something, it generally does a pretty good job. And when I&#8217;ve, you know, in my life, and experiencing with using AI tools, the best results usually come from a feedback loop of, it presents you options, and you either choose, I like this one, or you ask for edits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t have a tool that does that very well. We have some inline text options, but it&#8217;s pretty basic. And what&#8217;s interesting for me, just because of using AI for myself, where I feel like our next realm of where we want to go to, is a more iterative thing, because I&#8217;ve seen that AI does a better job when we go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So part of that decision making, of like, where are we going? It&#8217;s based on, I use ChatGPT every day, pretty much. And when I get the best results from it, is when I&#8217;ve said, okay, that&#8217;s close, but edit this, or change this. And I think that iterative approach, if we can bring that into a UI, can be really interesting when we talk about, how do we build very custom and interesting layouts inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our challenge right now is, what does a page wizard look like that&#8217;s iterative, that allows you to say, I want this page to be about this, show me some examples? We show you some examples, and then you choose the one that&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m feeling this, don&#8217;t like that section, I would like more on this, and then generate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, to me, could get really interesting, in terms of like getting you to that 90% of like, this page is 90% there, and I&#8217;m going to go in and tweak some of the text. But yeah, I think that&#8217;s all kind of how we&#8217;re choosing where to go is, trying and playing with the AI ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It almost sounds like you are envisaging a future, in which you have a conversation with a page. So you&#8217;ve got something in front of you, maybe that was generated by something, using your templates. But maybe it was something that you created yourself. And then the AI is somehow in a conversation where you discuss, and you say, I would like the headline to be shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, right, give me several options, we&#8217;ve done that. That image is in the wrong place, can we move that round to the other side? And that picture of a cat, replace it with a picture of a lion or, you get the idea. So you are talking, in effect, to the page. Am I describing your intuitions there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yes. Although I am scared of anything that relies on us to prompt the AI. So, I do want to have that talking, but I want to really focus on, rather than doing too much of, you can just raw text in, because that&#8217;s that same problem with the white page of like, I don&#8217;t know what to ask the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to do a lot more of, we&#8217;re going to give you options, choose the one you like, and then mini select options inside of that. Or like, where we can guide that to where it&#8217;s really just a bunch of clicks, instead of relying on you to communicate well with an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The pace of AI is moving so quickly. I really meant it when I said that two years ago, nobody was talking about it. I have no recollection of it being an important subject in the WordPress space. And now it seems to be almost everything that I hear, be it on mainstream media, or in the tech press or in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow AI manages to get itself in there, because everybody&#8217;s so fascinated by it. I just wonder where you get your inspiration from. Now it may be that there are commercial rivals inside of WordPress, you can mention things or not mention things. Or maybe there are things happening in the wider world that, you know, being where you are now in the tech space, and the company that you work for, there&#8217;s probably tendrils that you can use via that company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s just other things that you&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS space, or things that you&#8217;ve watched on television, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just curious, because I genuinely feel like the whole thing is a bit of a storm, and you&#8217;re being blown around, and some things seem to be landing, and other things seem to, we have a go and it fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are telling me that the metrics that you are getting are saying that what you&#8217;ve built is working, which is great. But I can imagine that six months from now, something else will have come along, spun the whole thing around, and you are going to have to get, well, not back to the drawing board, but you might well have to reimagine the things that you&#8217;ve done. So where do you even begin to look for inspiration in this space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think there is always a fear that someone will come and top you, in such a way that will make you irrelevant. I&#8217;m not worried about that personally, but I get it, and I definitely know that it exists. I think there&#8217;s a lot more involved in like someone just being able to come and trump you that hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We announced Kadence AI last March, and it&#8217;s honestly annoying to me that it wasn&#8217;t until January of this year that we officially launched it publicly. We had a beta version last summer. So we&#8217;ve had our cards on the table for a long time of like, this is what we&#8217;re building and this is how it&#8217;s going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that there&#8217;s other plugins and products that have done other things, I mean, Jetpack itself released an AI. And that does a lot of inline, you know, editing great for bloggers, where you want to generate content. I know that there&#8217;s other WordPress AI generated page builders, ZipWP is one. Great product in their approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there&#8217;s definitely different ways to go about it. And for us, we put our cards on the table last March, we had to get that done. And the trickiest parts were getting the AI to consistently respond, in a format that allowed us to input that into the content that we had. And then trial and error, and things like that really came into play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big piece for us, which was kind of annoying, we had to spend so much time on it, but we have a large user base. And we needed to create a credit system for our licenses, that allowed us to give everyone access to this tool, but also protect ourselves, because every time this communication happens with OpenAI, it costs us money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was an annoying, massive overhaul of a product licensing system, that had to have backward compatibility, and be implemented across our product line. And that delayed AI by several months, frustratingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, as far as like choosing where to go from here, we have a channel at work that&#8217;s like AI stuff. Essentially, someone in our org is posting in there every single day with, have you seen this tool? Have you seen this tool? I mean, I&#8217;m curious. I&#8217;m all in on, I&#8217;m watching the videos, what are they doing? I&#8217;m really interested. I want to know what people are doing, and how they&#8217;re thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;m also using ChatGPT everyday, because I want to make sure that I&#8217;m really staying engaged with it, and then allowing myself to think, how do I improve upon what we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think is a lot different than like, what if you had a blank slate? You had no customer base, and you&#8217;re trying to create a product that&#8217;s unique. That&#8217;s a little bit harder to do versus like, here we have 400,000 active installs with Kadence blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these customers need, and how do I give them the tools? And, how does AI benefit them? And to me, AI is a tool, it is not a solution. And I think that that&#8217;s really important in my mind, in terms of thinking of, how can I use AI, and how can I bring AI into the Kadence world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting. Over the last few years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that you, or Kadence, we could use those interchangeably perhaps, have achieved, and I&#8217;m doing air quotes, success. You know, three years ago, I suspect the install base was almost nowhere near the number that you just quoted at us. And it&#8217;s been a real rise. So congratulations for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was something that I was going to ask you about, whether or not that growth forces you to put the brakes on a little bit? In the sense that, you know, you&#8217;ve got this existing user base, you can&#8217;t possibly ship something which breaks 400,000 plus websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, you have to get their buy-in, in a way. And I know that they&#8217;re your customers, but they&#8217;re also the people that you need. And so if you do something shockingly different all of a sudden, we know how that goes. That typically doesn&#8217;t go well. So just an intuition as to whether or not you can&#8217;t be quite as nimble as you would like to be, or if there&#8217;s the breaks that you&#8217;ve got to put on. Do you have to be ultra cautious? Difficult question, and maybe one that you&#8217;re not willing to answer, but i&#8217;ll throw it out there anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I would say that the speed of development has changed, because we have improved our systems. Which, on one hand, slows us down a little bit more, in terms of some of the rapid releases I was doing early on, when it was like me and no one else, or like me and my sister and a support person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve definitely slowed down from some of that, but we&#8217;ve also done a lot less hot fixes, and bug fixes, because we&#8217;ve implemented more QA and testing. You know, obviously like we&#8217;ve helped that system a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also done a lot of stuff, and Kadence over the years, that has improved the code quality, and the structure of the code significantly. But backward compatibility is really tricky, and there are lots of times in a developer&#8217;s life, man, this would be so much easier if we could just start from scratch. Because so much changes, and Kadence Blocks was built originally before Gutenberg was part of Core. We released it in September, and it became part of Core in December of 20 or 2019, 2018. Gosh, I can&#8217;t even remember the year that Gutenberg became part of Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;ve rewritten product multiple times, to try to keep it up to date, and it&#8217;s always a challenge. And that backward compatibility is always a challenge. And just even, I mean, when we originally wrote it, Grid CSS and Flex CSS were not fully supported as like things that you could use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like, just even the structure of our blocks were so different, because we couldn&#8217;t rely on some of this new CSS, and that challenge is real. And that desire to just, give me a clean slate from a developer. Every developer will tell you, they would love that iterative, fixing of older code is so hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s the hard work. And that has slowed us down, certainly it has slowed us down. But I&#8217;m also really proud of that work, because we&#8217;ve really fought to do as much as we possibly can to keep backward compatibility, and to continue to improve the code base, so that we&#8217;re thinking future. And so yes, you know, we&#8217;ve had a lot of success, and things have changed for me and, you know, my day-to-day in a large part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what&#8217;s causing the slowdown is not necessarily that we&#8217;ve been successful, as much as all the other things that come into play, when you talk about a product that&#8217;s been around for more than a couple years. And that&#8217;s the, we got to do a major revamp on this code base, and we&#8217;ve got to prepare all these blocks for what we&#8217;re doing in Gutenberg today versus, you know, four years ago, that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Prior to the whole advent of AI and all of that, did you have a roadmap which looked really different than what it is now? Because I don&#8217;t build software, but I can imagine that if I did build software, I&#8217;d want to be staring into the future as far as I could go. I would want that roadmap to be, you know, agile, but at least have some North Star to be heading towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering, if AI kind of upended that, it was more of a case of, oh okay, there&#8217;s this, right. Throw all that away. Did any of that happen? Did you have to sort of retool the team, or take new people on, or just, like I say, throw away the old roadmap and begin again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Roadmap for me, or generally like Kadence, is usually not too much more than six months out. Mostly because we learn a lot from our users. The users determine the roadmap more than any other factor, and we&#8217;re continuously updating what we&#8217;re going to be working on in six months, because things change and WordPress changes. So it&#8217;s not as long term as you might think. Like, I don&#8217;t know what Kadence will be developing next January. I have some ideas, certainly. Some back of the mind thoughts, but nothing that we have committed to or decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the main shift that happened for us is ChatGPT came out, and within a month we were like, we&#8217;re not building starter templates anymore. And that was the big shift. We were kicking out starter templates, at least two a month, of these, you know, niche sites. And we just decided then to pull the plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were like, the future is going to be AI generated starter templates. We have to solve that problem. Let&#8217;s stop spending any resources that we can, on the old way of, it&#8217;s old and we just had released them, right? But like that old way of thinking. And that was, what did AI do in terms of shifting our mindset? It was like, we&#8217;ve got to put everything into getting AI starter templates out the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, because I&#8217;m part of Stellar, we didn&#8217;t have to go to the Kadence dev team, and I&#8217;m one of them, right? And say, you guys who are working on all this stuff that we were doing, we were working on some major dynamic content stuff, some advanced query block stuff, big rewrite of Kadence blocks. We didn&#8217;t have to go to that team and say, everybody stop what you&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;re doing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were able to pull resources from our parent company, and that was the team. We formed a whole new team to say, let&#8217;s see if we can solve the AI problem. Which I was a part of, but I wasn&#8217;t the entirety of that team. And so I spent the last year, half on Kadence and half on AI. And that&#8217;s probably not accurate time, but like basically I&#8217;ve been on two teams. Then I got our Kadence team involved, as we integrated the AI stuff we had done into Kadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how we were able to do that, is we were able to think, okay, we have a use case for how Kadence is going to use AI. But from a Stellar level, all of our products could benefit. LearnDash, for example, has already implemented AI into it. You can get a course outline done using AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we went and developed backend tools, and a server that does all the proxy communication with OpenAI, and all the caching, and all of that licensing piece. That was work that a different team, not the Kadence dev team did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really helped in us being able to keep releasing things with Kadence theme, and Kadence blocks all of last year, while there was another team working on this whole AI piece. And then towards the end of last year, we spent that time integrating it really into, well, I mean we&#8217;ve been doing it the whole time. We had a beta version out last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, that work then bringing in more of the Kadence dev team, and support team, and all of that to kind of get it out the door. That came at the end where it&#8217;s like, when we announced, hey, we&#8217;re going to do AI, there was a lot of fear that, well, what about your roadmap? What about you guys developing this or that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that was the feedback we were getting, is everyone was very concerned, hey, AI seems like it could be a fad. And we were like, no, hold on, we&#8217;re still doing that. We were just fortunate enough to be able to have resources from outside of our brand, come in and work on a lot of the AI stuff. And so that helped a lot with the roadmap. But obviously the starter templates piece was a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really nice that in the background you&#8217;ve got a bigger company, and the AI piece, a lot of the technologies, there&#8217;ll be a lot of commonality there. And so if you build that backend, like you say, the tooling that you need for LearnDash, and all of the different bits and pieces that make up the StellarWP Suite. And you can all share in the benefits of all of that rather than, I don&#8217;t know, five or six different companies all trying to achieve the same thing. So the economies of scale work really well there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty brave decision though, I&#8217;ve got to say, because I think, if you were to go back four or five years, everybody was, do you remember NFTs and Crypto and all that? There was that same euphoria, and it was going to be the future. And I think there&#8217;s quite a lot of people who down tools, and just moved in that direction. And fast forward to today, that now looks like it was a mistake. I think we can probably consign that to the dustbin of history. Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong about that, but it feels like that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And intuitions a couple of years ago about, let&#8217;s throw everything at AI, that could have gone the same way. It didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think it did. It really doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to go that way. It looks like it&#8217;s going to continue into, you know, for the next decade or however. Again, I could be wrong about that. But it&#8217;s a brave decision for you, the company to make. And it looks like you&#8217;re on the right side of history, so it&#8217;s a sigh of relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think the fact that NFTs, so many people were like, what is this, and how does it work, and all of that? It&#8217;s part of the reason why you could get on board with AI a lot easier, because everybody could open up ChatGPT and go, oh wow, this isn&#8217;t the annoying Verizon Wireless, or whatever, large company chat bot that I get at support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very different and improved. And I think that&#8217;s part of why it wasn&#8217;t easy to be like, this could be implemented and used, and be very useful. And I would say we did the bare minimum of, we&#8217;re doing text replacement on layouts. The future of having an AI do more creative, and I&#8217;m using air quotes when I say creative, work with you, is going to be really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think that it&#8217;s a phenomenal tool to work with you. Like, as far as you being able to guide it, influence it. I think it&#8217;s going to take a lot of the time consuming, exhausting work of making this all look exactly right out, which is going to be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am going to get into the nuts and the bolts of the actual stuff that you&#8217;ve built over at Kadence. I dropped a URL at the beginning. It&#8217;ll be in the show notes. If you go over to there, you&#8217;re going to find a video right at the top of the page. Caveat emptor. I don&#8217;t know if that will be there in the days, weeks, or months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a video. It&#8217;s a few minutes long. I think it&#8217;s you, Ben, it sounds like you. And you are running through the process of basically building a WordPress website from scratch. And I&#8217;m going to paraphrase it, and if I miss a step out here, forgive me, but I&#8217;ll just, for the sake of brevity, I&#8217;ll just paraphrase it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, you begin this wizard, and you enter some basic details. Details about your company. You describe the business, it spits back at you some possible keywords, and you select those. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you do what you often do with AI, you pick a tone, you know, this sort of feeling of how you wish the website to be. And then you go into the image selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of that gets consumed by the AI. It has a think for, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right word. It does what it does. And then it brings back some layouts for you. And you&#8217;ve got this selection of layouts, and your intuition says, that&#8217;s the one. So you pick that. You then start adjusting colors, and it disallows, or at least it prompts you that that&#8217;s not going to be a good selection, in terms of accessibility, which is nice, thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you mess around with the fonts a little bit, and you import some pages that you wish, that you think would be appropriate. So you&#8217;re nearly there. You, at that point, launch the site, if you wish. All the pages get imported, and your site is ready to be launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you&#8217;re into the process of tweaking it, and making it your own. I think anybody using AI would advise you to do. Edit with the block editor, go in, use the AI to amend things if you wish, or just do it yourself. And then you can begin the process of saying, actually, this row is just way off message. Let&#8217;s just swap that one out, and just pick a different one. And again, the AI can step in and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that took me longer to say than it takes to do, I suspect. That is pretty incredible. And it&#8217;s leveraging all the different bits and pieces that you mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this in any way bound to the products that you release? So I know that you&#8217;ve got a theme. I know that you&#8217;ve got a block suite, and there&#8217;s a pro version of that block suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having played with it myself, I can see that you&#8217;ve definitely used the blocks that are at your disposal. But, how does that work if I don&#8217;t have access to your pro suite? Would I even be able to use this? Is this available? Is there any kind of free plan? Can I just pay for the AI bit? And what if I decide that I want to back away from it and, I don&#8217;t know, amend things? Is there any lock in, is essentially what I&#8217;m saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Certainly. There is a free tool. Kadence Blocks is free, and Kadence Theme is free, and Kadence Starter Templates is free. You can get a free account to use AI. You&#8217;ll get 250 credits, which is more than enough to build a website. You could build a couple with that many credits. And so if you&#8217;re using free, you will have slightly limited choices into which layout you can choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you get to the point where you&#8217;re shown layouts, we&#8217;re going to give you, let&#8217;s call it six. Two of those will be pro only. And that means that when we design those layouts, they&#8217;re actually using pro blocks that we have. And so if you imported them, it wouldn&#8217;t work, because you don&#8217;t have pro, so you can&#8217;t access those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one of the free layouts, which I&#8217;ve already looked at one of our, you know, our more popular one is a free one right now. You can do the whole thing for free. And you don&#8217;t have any cost to you. You can go and try it out. We have a way for you to try it out in InstaWP as well. And that&#8217;s free. So if you just want to like play around, that is on our site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as content lock, and this goes into a really interesting conversation of, how avoidable is content lock in WordPress, and in websites in general? And, how do we get away from that? Because the blocks are part of the core editor, if you delete Kadence blocks from your website, the HTML markup will still exist on your website, because it&#8217;s just block markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the rendering of those blocks won&#8217;t function, because they depend on Kadence blocks to be rendered. And that&#8217;s how all custom blocks work in WordPress, is that if you have a custom block, you need that code to essentially handle the rendering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is work, and we&#8217;re scoping some of this out. There is work, and Matt Mullenweg talked about this State of the Word, to do more data liberation. Where you could say, I&#8217;m using Kadence Blocks, but I want to convert this to Core Blocks, or I&#8217;m using Spectra Blocks, and I want this to convert to Kadence Blocks, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with that, is that there is almost never a one for one with any of these tools. Elementor to Kadence, Elementor to Core. All of these kinds of ideas of being able to migrate out of one system into another is fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is the text and images. Not fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is a one for one of this to that, because Kadence Blocks wouldn&#8217;t exist if we didn&#8217;t massively expound upon what&#8217;s in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one would use it, if it didn&#8217;t take it a whole lot further. And so to convert these blocks to core blocks, you will lose functionality. You will lose the ability to have the accordions, and the tabs, and the sliders, and the certain types of image overlays and animations, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is there content lock? Yes. There&#8217;s content lock with core blocks as well. If you want to take core blocks to the classic editor, that doesn&#8217;t really work. So it all depends on what your definition of content lock is, and whether or not you feel like this is the system that&#8217;s going to be around for a while, and supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think, when you look at Kadence, we&#8217;re backed by a much larger company. There&#8217;s a lot of longevity in using Kadence Blocks, in terms of being able to render out those blocks for you, and the focus on backward compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I think data liberation is really interesting? Absolutely. I think where I think about data liberation is, how do we get, and this is what AI, I think, could be really good at. How do we get out of the mindset of, can I move from HTML to WordPress, or Wix to WordPress, or Core Blocks to Kadence Blocks, or Elementor to Beaver Builder, or whatever it is that you want to move?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we stop thinking about tools and go, you have a website, it&#8217;s HTML and JavaScript? Can we train an AI to convert that to some kind of standardised information? Where it basically says, here&#8217;s the JSON markup of this site. This is the type of content it is. Everyone builds importers for that type of thing, so you could say, I want this site in Kadence Blocks. And we use AI to convert that site into some kind of standardised markup that says, here&#8217;s all the content, the type of content, the context for how that content is. And then Kadence Blocks is an importer for that, or WordPress Core has an importer for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wouldn&#8217;t still be a one for one, because, again, there&#8217;s just no way you&#8217;re going to get a one for one, unless you convert straight to HTML. You could move it, but you wouldn&#8217;t actually be able to use it down the road. But what could be really interesting is, if you could then import that markup into whatever tool of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it might not be a one for one in design, but in terms of actually usable, and now those blocks will render, and are editable, and you can tweak the styling. And you&#8217;re that much closer. That to me is really, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the exploration for us is, can we create a system that exports? You know, where we think about grabbing the front end content, getting that into some kind of standardised system, importing that, and then exporting that in and out of that standardised system. I think that there&#8217;s a lot of really interesting stuff, in terms of just being able to process that and say, could this be a thing that we work toward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would take a lot of resources and energy, but would solve all of the weird platform specific stuff. Today what you need is a Wix to WordPress thing. Okay, like I totally get that. But I think down the road as AI gets a lot better at scraping sites, and understanding context, and being able to create, say, hey, this is an area that has media and text, that are related to each other. And we could conceive of a way of like, here&#8217;s all of the way that AI&#8217;s going to convert that content into a standardised format. And that could be really interesting for data liberation of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. The data liberation thing, really is about CMS to CMS at the moment, isn&#8217;t it? You know, it&#8217;s Shopify to WooCommerce and it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, Joomla to WordPress, or whatever it may be. But that more granular piece of, could I come from, let&#8217;s say Joomla, through WordPress, and the tools that I&#8217;m using inside of WordPress, that&#8217;s Kadence. So, can we go that extra step? Not just import it into Core Blocks, but can we then go a little bit further, because I&#8217;ve invested in Kadence, I know what I&#8217;m doing over there. Let&#8217;s give that a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, that&#8217;s really fascinating. And obviously, in everybody&#8217;s interest, if there&#8217;s some standardised way of doing that, and everybody could jump on board, so even your commercial rivals. You could access it, then the import isn&#8217;t the problem, it&#8217;s the quality of the product that is the reason why people would wish to import it. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting idea, and not one that I thought of, the data liberation thing. Yeah, we&#8217;ll see how that goes in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the AI, the way that I deployed it was into a vanilla site, to test out what you&#8217;d got. Also I noticed, I could be wrong about this, but on the video that you posted on the website, it felt like that was a vanilla site. How does the AI work if, because most people are not starting from scratch, are they? A lot of the audience listening to this, will wish to try things out on sites that they&#8217;ve already got, and push the boundaries of pages that they&#8217;ve already got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that the blocks themselves, they can be adapted. You&#8217;ve got a bit in the, you know, the bar that appears when you interact with Gutenberg. There&#8217;s something in there which you can interact with the AI and prompt it, and what have you. But does the whole wizard that we described earlier, is there any utility in that, if you&#8217;ve already got a site? Or, is it just for beginning blank slate stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> So that Wizard, you don&#8217;t need to generate a website, although you can, and you can import that into an existing site, if you want to. That&#8217;s totally fine. But Gutenberg, we have what&#8217;s called a design library. And if you have Kadence Blocks installed, you&#8217;ll see the design library tab in the backend, like in a page editing thing at the top bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you open that up, we can generate contextual stuff, using that same information from the wizard. So if you are building a page, for example, and you&#8217;re like, I need a call to action section, that&#8217;s a context that we&#8217;ve created. You can go in and say, I want all of your sections with call to action context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the AI generated text that is for your website, about call to action. And then you can pick from the layouts. And there&#8217;s hundreds, we have over 600 different patterns in that design library. And all of those can be empowered by AI, and many of them can be used multiple times. So you might see a pattern and say, well, that&#8217;s a great pattern, that I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can put about context into it, or I can put value proposition context into it, or call to action context into it. So you can choose the context, and then you can choose the pattern type, and then you can drop that pattern into your website. So if you have an existing website and you&#8217;re like, I even have an existing page, and I just want a section, AI can help you there. Or if you&#8217;re building a new page, and you want to piece together patterns, there&#8217;s a lot of different ways that you can use that tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you can go back through and kind of retrofit, and just swap things out. And presumably, rows and patterns kind of used interchangeably there. You can just save those, put them somewhere else for later keeping. But the idea is that you can put these different contexts in, so that you can modify the things that you&#8217;ve got. Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the stack that&#8217;s in the background? I mean, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s OpenAI, because everybody seems to be using OpenAI. Are you keeping an open mind about OpenAI? Now there&#8217;s a phrase I should coin. Because it does seem like hot on the heels of OpenAI, you know, they really were first to market with this interactive chat like capability. Which is very beguiling, but it does seem like hot on the heels are Anthropic and Google, with all of their offerings. Are you wedded to OpenAI, well, first of all, is it OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:32] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It is open AI, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And second of all, are you wedded to that, or do you keep exploring the different models? Because it does feel, in certain contexts, that OpenAI might be feeling the pressure, let&#8217;s say. I&#8217;ve tried a few different ones out, and in a variety of different contexts, OpenAI excels. In a few, very niche contexts, there are some rivals, which absolutely, you know, they just seem to do a much better job. So anyway, I&#8217;ll just hand that one over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I think we are very much open-minded, in terms of what we do. Part of us building this whole proxy server to handle, and this whole prompt database, and the way that we communicate with OpenAI. The whole time we were thinking, this structure, all that we&#8217;re doing, if we need to switch to some other system. Because OpenAI changes their prices, or they discontinue doing what we&#8217;re using the for, or for whatever reason, we need to make sure it&#8217;s movable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have experimented with Google&#8217;s, and right now we&#8217;re using OpenAI. But in a year from now, we might not be. And I think that was a key part for us of, like we need to make sure that we have the ability to shift and move, if we&#8217;re seeing a new company come up that is significantly better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you never know. Maybe there&#8217;s somebody who&#8217;s developing something which is really adjacent to the web design industry, and an AI which is specifically for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you&#8217;ve built, this conduit between the website and the AI. You&#8217;ve built this middleware, which sits in between. And that middleware could just be repurposed at a moment&#8217;s notice, to talk to the, I don&#8217;t know, the Gemini or Anthropic API. And so, really, you wouldn&#8217;t have much disruption to service. Ah, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:08] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> We&#8217;ve got that server in two different places, so we can experiment too. So we can experiment by just locally pinging saying, hey, use the backup server, and then, let&#8217;s experiment with that. So we have a lot of ability to do things, to test things, without disrupting our user base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that there was some sort of credit system, whereby you acquire credits, which then you spend, in order to do the transactions with the AI. How does that work? Is that like a monthly thing that you add on top? Is that a subscription service on top, or do you get a certain package when you purchase it? Just run us through how that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you mentioned that 250 credits was available on the free version. You also mentioned that that would probably get you through the process of building a couple of websites. So yeah, just talk us through the typical spend on doing things, and how the credit system works, and how do you top things up if you&#8217;re an agency, and a blowing through your credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, so we aren&#8217;t charging anything extra for the credits. They come with whatever you have. So if you&#8217;ve purchased from us, you get credits automatically into your account. And if you have an existing purchase, and if you go and purchase today, our pro products have a certain amount of credit. So Kadence Blocks Pro alone is 1200. If you go up to our essential bundle, which is Kadence Blocks Pro and Theme Pro and Starter Templates Pro, that is going to give you 4,000 credits, and then up from that is 8,000 credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We largely created the credits as a deterrent to prevent abuse, not as a system to sell you something more. And our goal is that you don&#8217;t need a separate subscription. And we want to make it so easy to use, or you&#8217;re not really worried too much about your credit count. To that point we&#8217;re talking about single lifetime credit bundle packages, that you&#8217;ll be able to buy for that agency, that&#8217;s burning through their credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going tomake that very, very cost effective. Because, again, we didn&#8217;t ever consider that credits could ever be a revenue driver. We have no plan for it to be a revenue driver. We literally just want to protect ourself on cost. So going forward, there&#8217;ll be some way to buy credits very cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole communication and stuff with OpenAI is relatively cheap. That&#8217;s part of the reason why it&#8217;s so usable, so many people are building on it, is because being able to communicate with the AI is cheap. When you take it out to a scale of 400,000 active installs, and things like that, you start to go, oh wow, this could get expensive pretty quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s where, you know, we need to limit some of that. But in general, the idea is that we give you more than enough credits. And if you are an agency, or you&#8217;re burning through a lot of credits, we&#8217;re going to make it very cheap for you to buy more. Current plan right now is a $20 package that&#8217;s going to have like 4,000 extra credits. So we&#8217;re going to make it really simple for you to just say like, oh, top me up, I need more credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just, before we wind it up, let&#8217;s close the lid on Kadence itself. And let&#8217;s just talk about your intuitions, Ben, about AI in general. Now, I&#8217;m not trying to force you to say anything here or to, you know, imply that you&#8217;ve got a certain opinion. But I&#8217;m curious as to what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s two phrases that I&#8217;m just going to raise, and one is that, you know, a rising tide carries all boats. In other words, we throw AI into the mix, and everybody&#8217;s experience of life, and website building, and all of that, just becomes better. And then there&#8217;s another phrase which is, just a race to the bottom, which is entirely the opposite, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering if you have any intuitions about that. Because, certainly amongst the people that I&#8217;ve met, who are jobing website developers, you know, they&#8217;re using tools, much like you&#8217;ve got, and rivals, to build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is this sort of impending sense of fear amongst some of them, that the very tools which seem so beguiling at the moment, and seem so brilliant because they save a bit of time here, you know, save a minute there, and an hour there and what have you. That all is great, except that there&#8217;s this fear that maybe these tools are going to hollow out the very industry that we&#8217;re serving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the point where, well, in a few years time, you&#8217;ll just go to some webpage and tell it, I want a website to market my cat food, off you go. And, you know, three minutes later you&#8217;re done, and it&#8217;s all finished. So I wonder if you&#8217;ve been thinking about that, if you&#8217;ve got any guardrails in place, or intuitions there. I know that&#8217;s a fairly ephemeral question, it&#8217;s hard to get your hands on. But just a few minutes on your thoughts around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:15] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Sure. I think, if you are a freelancer who&#8217;s building brochure websites, and not offering anything else, other than, here&#8217;s your website, that would be a concern. I think that&#8217;s a valid concern of like, will these customers keep coming to me, for this very simple brochure website, if that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m offering?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that&#8217;s been going away for a while, and that freelancers, if you&#8217;re paying attention, you&#8217;re probably already looking at, how can I help people have an effective website, not just a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there was a time where everyone was like, I just need a website. There&#8217;s just so many local businesses that were like, I just need a website. I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of that time, and most businesses are not just saying, I need a brochure website. They&#8217;re saying, I need a website that helps me do business, even these local companies. That is able to capture on SEO, that&#8217;s able to adequately supply a convincing marketing message for someone to choose them over their competition. That represents them well online, and that allows them to be effective, and continue to serve their local communities, or broader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, I think if you&#8217;re a freelancer, you should be really thinking about and learning about marketing. And really thinking and learning about SEO. Because what you want to be able to offer is, yeah, this might look like a brochure website, but let me show you how it&#8217;s actually effective. Let me show you how we positioned your marketing messaging to make it effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are running the ability to do social media ads, and everything else. Like, there&#8217;s just so much more that most businesses need, most anyone who&#8217;s going to be online. I feel like, if all you&#8217;re offering is a brochure site, and done and move on, that is at risk. Because I do think that AI can create a very basic brochure site, that someone will be able to say, that&#8217;s good enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s what the majority of, especially WordPress freelancers, are really trying to pitch someone on. And I think that you just need to make sure that you are continuing to grow yourself. To say, I understand the web, the intricacies of marketing, and SEO. And I can help you, not just to make a good looking website that has your content, but make it so it&#8217;s actually something that people will be able to find, and that&#8217;s going to actually grow your business, or improve your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t think AI is going to be able to solve that. I think tools will help you solve for that. But I don&#8217;t think AI, on its own, or anything automated like that, is just going to be able to solve for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think the only thing that I know that AI will do in the future, is be an agent of change. Whatever that change is, it&#8217;s more or less a question of just putting my finger in the air and guessing, I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s fascinating to get your perspective on it, because a lot of the people that I talk to are those freelancers, they&#8217;re the people building websites. And interesting to get a different perspective. A company that&#8217;s building the tools to enable those freelancers to do the work, and all of the concerns, and thought that you are putting into building out those tools. Really fascinating conversation, I enjoyed that tremendously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before we call it a day, Ben, I&#8217;m wondering if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just sharing some of the places, or place, where people could get in touch with you, if they wish to. I will drop the URL, like I said, of the Kadence website. So if there&#8217;s anything aside from that, just let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:36] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> I&#8217;m not super active on social media, but best place would be our Kadence Facebook group. That is the one place on social media I will come in and out of. I&#8217;m not a huge social media person, but that&#8217;s one that I, that community is super fun, and I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will find a lot of very engaged people in there. So you can go in there and ping me in there. And that&#8217;s probably your best, outside of, obviously you can come to the Kadence website, and just click on our support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Great. Thank you so much, Ben. It was really a pleasure chatting to you today, all about Kadence, but also about AI. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/\">Kadence WP</a>, a company that specialises in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites. The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021 Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand, where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there’s a suite of popular plugins, including LearnDash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI-generated content and images. Ben’s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started, right through to today where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow; AI is still new, and it’s possible that what’s all the rage today might be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai/\">Next level site creation with AI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zipwp.com/\">ZipWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">LearnDash</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stellarwp.com/\">StellarWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://instawp.com/\">InstaWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/webcreatorcommunity/\">Kadence Facebook Group</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Akismet: Comment Spam: How to Protect Your Site from Spammers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283729\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20579:\"<p>Everyone has encountered spam comments at one point or another, but they&#8217;re more than just an eyesore. They actually scare away real visitors, can mess with your search engine rankings, and can even pose serious cybersecurity risks. It&#8217;s a big deal, whether you&#8217;re running a small blog or a major&nbsp;business.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, there&#8217;s something you can do about it, and you don’t have to go it alone. Today, we&#8217;ll talk about what comment spam is and why it&#8217;s so important to tackle it&nbsp;head&#8209;on.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll also discuss why<a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\"> Akismet</a> is your website&#8217;s best protection against spam comments. It quietly filters out all that junk (without interrupting users with annoying quizzes or buttons to click), so your site stays clean and professional — a place where real conversations can happen&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283729\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam clutters up your website&#8217;s comment sections with unwanted messages. Spammers aren’t there to join the conversation but to push their own agenda, which is often sketchy at best. Because there are strong motivations for spammers’ efforts, those with programming knowledge constantly spend time developing new ways to bypass filters and spread spam automatically through sophisticated&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>Websites and online spaces are constantly evolving, and so are the methods to combat nuisances like comment spam. Google, for instance, rolled out a significant update in<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/10/october-2023-spam-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> October 2023</a> to tackle various types of spam, including cloaking, hacking, auto&#8209;generated, and scraped content across multiple languages​​​​. This shows just how serious the issue has become globally and the efforts being made to keep online spaces&nbsp;spam&#8209;free.</p>\n\n<p>You, however, will still need to take care in preventing comment spam on your own website or blog posts. But more on that in a&nbsp;moment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the motivations behind comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam is driven by several motivations, each with its own unique impact on websites and users. Understanding these motivations can help in developing more effective strategies to counter this prevalent&nbsp;issue.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. SEO link&nbsp;building</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing spammers are often after is improving their website&#8217;s ranking on search engines. They sneak links into blog comments or other pages with a comments section, hoping it&#8217;ll boost their site&#8217;s visibility. This trick is known as SEO poisoning because it can actually hurt your own rankings as a result. And it&#8217;s still a booming business, even with many efforts in place to counteract&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Malware&nbsp;distribution</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some of these comment spammers are out to spread malware. They use those sneaky SEO tactics to get their harmful content boosted in the search results or even post links directly to the malware in the comments themselves. When your visitors click on these links, they might end up with stolen data or&nbsp;worse.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Advertising and&nbsp;promotion</h3>\n\n<p>Lastly, some spammers are just trying to push their products or services. It&#8217;s like those people who hand out flyers on the street, except they&#8217;re leaving their flyers in your comments. They use all sorts of tactics to try to get through on thousands of sites a day (or more), and because they cast such a wide net, even a tiny success rate is worth it for&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these motivations creates different challenges for site administrators and blog owners. From an SEO standpoint, comment spam can really hurt your site&#8217;s ranking. The spammy people you let hang around can rub off and give you a bad reputation. If search engines find out you&#8217;re unintentionally hosting bad links, they might penalize you. It might not sound fair, but it&#8217;s a fact all the&nbsp;same.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The adverse effects of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam can significantly impact a website in various detrimental&nbsp;ways:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Site&nbsp;reputation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Imagine walking into a party and finding trash everywhere. That&#8217;s what a website swamped with spam comments feels like. It screams neglect and poor management. Visitors will likely think twice before engaging, and genuine community members? They might just leave.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And if those spam comments have links to shady sites, it makes it seem as though you&#8217;ve invited trouble right to your doorstep. Spam comments post a real hit to your site&#8217;s good&nbsp;name.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. SEO&nbsp;consequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>When it comes to SEO, comment spam, as we&#8217;ve already mentioned, is a real problem. Google’s got a sharp eye for sites that house spammy content. If your site is littered with this stuff, Google might think it&#8217;s not up to par, which can mean a nosedive in rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Imagine, just when you thought you were getting the hang of SEO, comment spam can pull the rug right from under you. It’s tough because a dip in search rankings means fewer visitors and, ultimately, a hit to potential&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Potential for site&nbsp;blocklisting</h3>\n\n<p>In the worst&#8209;case scenario, too much comment spam can get your site on the search engines&#8217; naughty list, i.e. blocklisted. This happens when your site is seen by search engines as a place with potentially harmful content or that at least links to dangerous websites. Recovering from a blocklisting is no joke, either. It&#8217;s a long and difficult process, so avoiding this is obviously&nbsp;preferable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common characteristics of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam typically exhibits several common characteristics that can help in identifying and filtering it&nbsp;out:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Links to external&nbsp;websites</h3>\n\n<p>First off, links in blog comments that lead to other sites are classic red flags. These aren&#8217;t just any links, though. They&#8217;re usually totally unrelated to your post and are all about getting more eyeballs on spammers&#8217; sites or boosting their SEO. Often these links pose major threats, leading to places you wouldn&#8217;t want your visitors to end&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n<p>With cybersecurity investments booming to $76 billion in 2023, according to<a href=\"https://hginsights.com/market-reports/market-report-socs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> HG Insights</a>, it&#8217;s clear everyone&#8217;s taking these threats seriously, and not just the big fish but small businesses,&nbsp;too​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Generic or flattering&nbsp;language</h3>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the flattery game. Spammers love to post comments using vague, super&#8209;positive comments like &#8220;Great post!&#8221; but they&#8217;re pretty empty and don&#8217;t add much value to your site. They&#8217;re trying to butter you up so you&#8217;ll let their comment slide through. And while not always spam, comments like these definitely raise red&nbsp;flags.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1074\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.png\" alt=\"example of a flattering spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283731\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Irrelevant&nbsp;content</h3>\n\n\n<p>Spam comments are completely off-topic. They&#8217;ll slap any old thing in the comment section, as long as they can sneak in a backlink or a plug for something. With phishing websites on the rise,&nbsp;it&#8217;s clear these irrelevant comments are part of a bigger online game.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1216\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of an off-topic spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283732\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Poorly written&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Spammers often use comments with grammatical errors either to sneak past filters searching for common spam words, to appear more human, or simply because they’re trying to write in a non&#8209;native language. So comments with numerous grammatical errors should be viewed with&nbsp;suspicion.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-2.png\" alt=\"example of a spam comment with lots of hashtags\" class=\"wp-image-283733\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Lots of pingbacks and&nbsp;trackbacks</h3>\n\n<p>These are automated or manual notifications sent when one website links to another. While they can enhance interaction between websites, they can also be used for spamming. Distinguishing between genuine and spam trackbacks or pingbacks involves assessing their relevance and the quality of the linking&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1440\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-3.png\" alt=\"example of a pingback on a blog post\" class=\"wp-image-283734\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. A sudden influx of&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>A ton of comments coming in at once, especially from new or unverified users, can be a sign of spam. This can be a coordinated effort to flood your site with spam&nbsp;comments.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Suspicious usernames or email&nbsp;addresses</h3>\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the weird usernames and email addresses. These are often pretty obvious with random numbers or bizarre word salad&#8209;style names. It&#8217;s all about creating fake identities to spread spam far and&nbsp;wide.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying these characteristics can help you in effectively managing and reducing the amount of comment spam on your website. And using tools like Akismet can help in automating the process of spam detection and&nbsp;removal.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why common anti&#8209;spam methods fall short (and what to do&nbsp;instead)</h2>\n\n<p>Common anti&#8209;spam methods, though widely used, have limitations that can make them less&nbsp;effective:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. CAPTCHA and its&nbsp;limitations</h3>\n\n\n<p>While you’re probably used to seeing CAPTCHAs or reCAPTCHAs (those tests that make you do things like decipher a string or random letters or check all the pictures with stoplights) in your everyday life, they can be a real headache for users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"828\" height=\"982\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-4.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA, asking users to select squares with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-283736\" />\n\n\n<p>Ever found yourself squinting at your screen, trying to figure out if that&#8217;s a letter or a smudge? You&#8217;re not alone. In fact, only about 66% of people get through these tests on their first try, according to the<a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/captchas-in-checkout\"> Baymard&nbsp;Institute</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the issue of accessibility. People with visual impairments can find themselves at a disadvantage with visual CAPTCHAs, and the audio alternatives have similar downfalls. Plus, those advanced bots you’re trying to block? They&#8217;re getting better at sneaking past these tests, making CAPTCHAs less effective by the&nbsp;day​​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Question&#8209;based&nbsp;challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Asking users a question to prove they&#8217;re human seems like a smart move. But it&#8217;s got its pitfalls, too. For one, bots can be programmed to answer common questions. And if your questions are too obscure or complex, you might end up turning away real humans who just wanted to interact with your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Limiting commenting to registered&nbsp;users</h3>\n\n<p>Making people sign up before they can comment is a decent barrier against spam, but it presents its own set of issues. Not everyone wants to go through the hassle of creating an account, especially if they&#8217;re just passing by. So, you might be keeping out the spam, but you&#8217;re also likely missing out on some valuable contributions from casual&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Manual review and approval of all&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Having a real person review each comment is great for quality control. But let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s a time&#8209;consuming task. If your site&#8217;s buzzing with activity, staying on top of all those comments can be a daunting, if not impossible,&nbsp;task.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these cases, using a tool like Akismet is a preferable option to keep comment spam under control. Now, let&#8217;s talk about&nbsp;why.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 tool to stop comment spam&nbsp;completely</h2>\n\n<p>Because of its popularity, you’ve probably heard of Akismet in the past — especially if you&#8217;re running a WordPress site. It&#8217;s kind of a big deal in the world of online spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<p>Created by Automattic, the people behind WordPress.com, Akismet has been at the forefront of spam solutions since 2005. It&#8217;s proven itself to be a reliable ally for website owners who are tired of dealing with comment spam, but don’t want to interrupt users with annoying, unreliable&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n\n<p>What you may not know is that Akismet provides solutions for more than just WordPress sites. Thanks to its flexible API connection, it can work with many other platforms like Drupal, phpBB3, and Joomla. Abiding by the open source philosophy, Akismet likes to say that it’s built <em>by</em> developers, <em>for</em> developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&nbsp;works</h3>\n\n\n<p>So, how does Akismet keep those spam comments at bay? It&#8217;s pretty smart. When someone (or some<em>thing</em>) leaves a comment on your site, fills out a form, or submits any other form of text, Akismet’s advanced AI program can analyze it for authenticity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It’s constantly evolving and learning to maintain its incredible 99.99% accuracy&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your configuration, it can set comments aside for you to review later or automatically delete suspicious ones. Based on your feedback, it can adapt to your site for even improved performance (if that’s even&nbsp;possible).</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is all automated — for both you and your site’s visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The benefits of using Akismet to block comment&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet stands out as the best way to block comment spam&nbsp;because:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It offers real&#8209;time monitoring and adaptability</strong>. Akismet&#8217;s cloud&#8209;based system constantly learns from the billions of data points it processes from its use on over 100 million sites, allowing it to adapt to new spam techniques and protect websites against the most advanced spam&nbsp;attacks​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It has a database of known spam patterns</strong>. It also uses a massive database and sophisticated algorithms to detect and block spam, which is continuously updated to recognize new spamming&nbsp;methods​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It boasts 99.99% spam detection accuracy</strong>. One of Akismet&#8217;s standout features is its high accuracy rate in spam detection, significantly reducing the likelihood of spam slipping through the&nbsp;cracks​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>You can set it and forget it</strong>. Once configured, Akismet runs autonomously, saving you considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual spam moderation​​.&nbsp;</li>\n\n<li><strong>It’s compatible with multiple platforms</strong>. Although primarily known for its integration with WordPress, Akismet can be utilized across various platforms, making it a versatile tool for spam&nbsp;protection​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It doesn’t affect the user experience</strong>. Unlike some anti&#8209;spam tools that can be intrusive or cumbersome for users (like CAPTCHAs), Akismet operates in the background without adding friction to the user experience. This is essential for high engagement and conversion&nbsp;rates​​.</li></ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to start blocking comment spam today with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n<p>Blocking comment spam with Akismet can significantly enhance your website&#8217;s user experience and security. Below is a straightforward step&#8209;by&#8209;step guide to get you&nbsp;started.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin</h3>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using WordPress, there&#8217;s a good chance Akismet is already pre&#8209;installed. However, if it&#8217;s&nbsp;not:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins → Add&nbsp;New</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Search for &#8220;Akismet&#8221; in the WordPress plugin&nbsp;directory.</li>\n\n<li>Click <strong>Install Now </strong>next to the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If Akismet isn&#8217;t pre-installed or if you&#8217;re not using WordPress, visit the </em><a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/getting-started/\"><em>getting started guide</em></a><em> for more information.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button within your WordPress dashboard to activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-5.png\" alt=\"installing Akismet in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-283737\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Obtain and input your API&nbsp;key</h3>\n\n<p>To connect your site to Akismet’s&nbsp;servers:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Visit the Akismet&nbsp;website.</li>\n\n<li>Sign up for an account to obtain an API&nbsp;key.</li>\n\n<li>Select the plan that fits your needs (free for personal blogs; paid subscriptions are available for businesses and commercial sites). Enterprise users can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise-pricing/\">create their own plan or discuss it with an expert</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n\n<li>Follow the instructions to generate your API&nbsp;key.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.jpeg\" alt=\"pricing plans for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-283738\" />\n\n\n<p>After obtaining your API&nbsp;key:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go back to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Akismet →&nbsp;Settings</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Enter your API key in the designated field and&nbsp;connect.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-6.png\" alt=\"adding an API key to Akismet settings\" class=\"wp-image-283739\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Configure Akismet&nbsp;settings</h3>\n\n<p>Once activated, review the default settings for Akismet by going to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti&#8209;Spam </strong>then finding the <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n<p>Determine how you&#8217;d like to handle comments flagged as spam as well as the <strong>Strictness</strong> of the spam&nbsp;filter.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Monitor and adjust as&nbsp;needed</h3>\n\n<p>With Akismet now operational, you&#8217;ll want to make monitoring the spam filtering process a part of your regular website maintenance schedule.

I will demonstrate my voyage towards WordPress as a freelancer to a full-time job holder and a contributor in the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-entered-into-the-world-of-wordpress\">How I Entered into the World of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2015, I began writing content as a freelancer, not knowing that WordPress would become such a big part of my life. At first, WordPress was just a tool for me to publish my writings. But soon, it turned into much more than that. It became the center of my career. When I graduated from Gono University with a Computer Science and Engineering degree, I didn&#8217;t imagine WordPress would be where I&#8217;d find my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-everyday-i-m-growing-with-wordpress\">Everyday I’m Growing with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After freelancing, I joined weDevs, a company known for creating WordPress plugins. This was a significant change for me. At weDevs, I wasn&#8217;t just writing; I was part of a team that made tools to help people build better websites. I learned a lot about WordPress and how it works from the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I moved to BuddyBoss, where I became a technical writer. This job was different because I had to explain how things work in a way that everyone could understand. It was challenging but also very rewarding. I enjoyed making complex ideas simple and helping others learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-volunteering-and-being-part-of-the-community\">Volunteering and Being Part of the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best parts of my journey has been volunteering at WordCamps and WordPress Meetups. Going beyond my work responsibilities, I made it a point to engage actively within the community. Till now, I have volunteered at several notable events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordCamp Kent 2020 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Northeast Ohio 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp India 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Asia 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Sylhet 2023</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These events have been enriching for me. They&#8217;ve allowed me to meet people as excited about WordPress as I am. It was great to see how strong and welcoming the WordPress community is, sharing knowledge and experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, currently, I am an Organizer of the WordPress Dhaka Community. All these years of working for WordPress paid me really well and recognized me as a community member to serve the Dhaka WordPress enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-i-ve-learned-through-the-journey\">What I&#8217;ve Learned Through the Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I see how much I&#8217;ve grown because of WordPress. It started as just a platform for my writing, but it became a way to connect with others, learn new skills, and share my knowledge. My career has taken me to places I never expected, and I&#8217;m grateful for all the opportunities WordPress has given me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that being open to new experiences and willing to learn can lead you to exciting places. WordPress has been a part of not only my career but also my personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress is far from over. There&#8217;s always something new to learn and more ways to contribute to the community. I&#8217;m excited to see where this path will take me next. Whether it&#8217;s writing, volunteering, or working on new projects, I&#8217;m ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-footnote\">Footnote</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice I made because of the joy and achievement it brings. My story is simple: it&#8217;s about finding your passion in unexpected places and growing with it. I hope it can inspire others to explore their interests and see where they lead.<br />When it comes to my hobbies, there&#8217;s a long list. I love traveling, reading, watching movies (but not web series), and listening to music. I have two furry babies, Judy and Deany (Shih-Tzu), and plan to adopt a cat soon. These personal joys add another layer of happiness and fulfillment to my life, making my journey with WordPress even more rewarding.

এ প্রতিষ্ঠানে আমি এমন একটি টিমের সাথে যুক্ত ছিলাম, যারা গ্রাহকদের জন্য আরও উন্নত ওয়েবসাইট তৈরি করার প্রয়োজনীয় সরঞ্জাম তৈরি করতো।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি সেখান থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস সম্পর্কে অনেক কিছুই শিখি এবং জানতে পারি কিভাবে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর ব্যাকএন্ড থেকে কাজ হয়। এরবাইরে&nbsp; আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্লাগিন মার্কেটিং নিয়েও এই প্রতিষ্ঠানে বেশকিছু উল্লেখযোগ্য কাজ করি।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এরপর, আমি BuddyBoss-এ যোগ দেই টেকনিক্যাল রাইটার হিসেবে। এখানে আমার কাজ পূর্বের কাজ থেকে ভিন্ন ধরনের। এখানে আমি কন্টেন্টের মাধ্যমে ব্যাখ্যা করি, কিভাবে একজন ব্যবহারকারী ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের ব্যাকএন্ড থেকে&nbsp; সঠিক ভাবে BuddyBoss প্লাগিন ব্যবহার করতে পারবে। এই কাজ আমার কাছে যেমন চ্যালেঞ্জিং ছিল তেমনি ছিল আমার ক্যারিয়ারের জন্য মাইলফলক। টেকনিক্যাল জটিল সব ব্যাপারগুলো সহজভাবে ব্যবহারকারীদের কাছে তুলে ধরতে এবং তাদেরকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শেখানোর কাজটি এখানে থেকে আমি উপভোগ করছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ভলেন্টিয়ার এবং কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে আমার যাত্রা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস পথচলার অন্যতম অংশ হচ্ছে ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এবং WordPress Meetups-এ ভলেন্টয়ারী কাজ করা। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক কাজের বাইরে যেয়ে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটিতে সক্রিয়ভাবে জড়িত থাকার চেষ্টা করি। এখন পর্যন্ত, আমি বেশ কয়েকটি উল্লেখযোগ্য ইভেন্টে ভলেন্টিয়ার হয়েছি:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>১।ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প কেন্ট ২০২০ (অনলাইন)<br />২। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প উত্তরপূর্ব ওহাইও ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৩। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প ইন্ডিয়া ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৪। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এশিয়া ২০২৩ <br />৫। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প সিলেট ২০২৩</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এই ইভেন্টগুলো আমার জন্য খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল। এ ইভেন্টগুলতে আমি আমার মতোই অন্য ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমিদের সাথে দেখা করার এবং যোগাযোগ করার সুযোগ পাই, যারা আমার মতই ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসকে ভালবাসে। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটি কতটা শক্তিশালী এবং কিভাবে তারা নতুনদের স্বাগত জানাচ্ছে, জ্ঞান আর অভিজ্ঞতা ভাগাভাগি করে নিচ্ছে এ ব্যাপারগুলো দেখতে পারা আমার কাছে দুর্দান্ত এক অভিজ্ঞতা ছিল।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বর্তমানে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস ঢাকা কমিউনিটির একজন অর্গানাইজার। ঢাকা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটির পক্ষ থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের ব্যাপারে উৎসাহীদের সহযোগিতা করতে আমাকে একটি কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে স্বীকৃতি দেয় যা আমার কাছে সত্যিকার ভাবেই অনেক সন্মানের।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">এ যাত্রাপথে আমি যা শিখেছি</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>অতীতের দিকে ফিরে তাকালে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের কারণে কোন পর্যায়ে এসেছি সেটা দেখতে পাই। যা আমার লেখা প্রকাশের একটি প্ল্যাটফর্ম হিসাবে শুরু হয়েছিল, সেটাই এখন অন্যদের সাথে সংযোগ করার মাধ্যম হিসেবে, নতুন দক্ষতা অর্জনের এবং আমার অভিজ্ঞতা অন্যদের সাথে ভাগ করার একটি মাধ্যম হয়ে উঠেছে। আমার কর্মজীবন আমাকে এমন এক জায়গায় নিয়ে এসেছে যা আমি কখনো কল্পনা করিনি। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসই আমাকে এই সব সুযোগ দিয়েছে এর জন্যে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর কাছে কৃতজ্ঞ।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি এখান থেকে শিখেছি নতুন কোনো অভিজ্ঞতা ও নতুন কিছু শেখার জন্য আগ্রহী থাকলে নিজেকে অসাধারণ সব জায়গায় নিয়ে যাওয়া সম্ভব। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধুমাত্র আমার কর্মজীবনই নয়, আমার ব্যক্তিগত জ্ঞান সমৃদ্ধিরও একটি অংশ।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আমার ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রা কখনোই শেষ হবার নয়। এখানে সবসময় নতুন কিছু শেখার আছে এবং কমিউনিটিতে অবদান রাখার আরও নানান উপায় আছে। এই পথচলা আমাকে পরবর্তী কোথায় নিয়ে যাবে তা দেখতে আমি খুবই উৎসাহী। আমি নতুন চ্যালেঞ্জ এবং সুযোগের জন্য সবসময় প্রস্তুত সেটা লেখা-লেখি, ভলেন্টিয়ারী, বা নতুন প্রজেক্টে কাজ করা যে ভাবেই হোক না কেন।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আজ এ পর্যন্তই</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে যাত্রা শুরু করা আমার জন্য হয়তো একটি কাকতালীয় ঘটনা ছিল, কিন্তু এখানে কাজ করে আমি যে আনন্দ পেয়েছি এবং যা অর্জন করেছি তা বলে শেষ করার মত নয়৷ আমি আশা করি, আমার এই পথচলার গল্প ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমীদের অনুপ্রাণিত করবে এবং আগামীতে নেতৃত্ব দিতে সাহায্য করবে৷</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার শখের একটি দীর্ঘ তালিকা আছে৷ আমি ঘুরে বেড়াতে, বই পড়তে, সিনেমা দেখতে (কিন্তু ওয়েব সিরিজ নয়), এবং গান শুনতে পছন্দ করি। আমার দুটি পোষা কুকুর আছে, জুডি এবং ড্যানি, এবং শীঘ্রই একটি বিড়াল দত্তক নেওয়ার ইচ্ছেও আছে৷ এই নির্মল আনন্দগুলো আমার জীবনে সুখ এবং পরিপূর্ণতার আরেকটি স্তর যোগ করে, যা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রাকে আরও বেশি ফলপ্রসূ করে তোলে প্রতিদিন। আপনি যদি আমার সাথে যোগাযোগ করতে চান তাহলে বিস্তারিত জানতে আমার ওয়েবসাইট&nbsp;

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser or specifically for this one; if you liked what you heard, share it with a fellow collaborator whether they know WordPress or not. But if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at wpbriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. <br /><br />[00:08:10] (Music outro)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Feb 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"Matt: Child of the 90s\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=111217\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://ma.tt/2024/02/child-of-the-90s/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:150:\"<p>This is a brilliant ad, true genius.

It brought so much clarity to things, we&#8217;ve been able to resolve in hours things that have lingered for months, including two acquisitions, several hires, big strategies, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this talk I caught a redeye to NYC to meet with the WordPress.com leadership team and hand off my leadership there to Daniel Bachhuber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a beautiful symmetry that the first-ever sabbatical taken at Automattic was by its CEO at the time, Toni Schneider, which gave me the opportunity to step in and try on being a CEO, and it&#8217;s an incredible gift that Toni is returning to be CEO of Automattic while I&#8217;m out for the months of February, March, and April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What am I going to do with all this free time?

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, using the GatherPress plugin for WordPress event organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Mike Auteri. Mike is an Associate Director of Engineering at Penske Media Corporation, as well as the founder and engineering lead of the GatherPress project. He&#8217;s contributed to WordPress Core and Gutenberg, is a WordPress community team supporter, has written plugins, presented at meetups and WordCamps, and is a co-organiser of the WordPress Monclair meetup in New Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve attended a WordPress meetup event, it&#8217;s quite likely that you registered for that via the meetup.com platform. It&#8217;s become the defacto way for organisers of events to plan their meetups, send out invites, subscribe users, and promote future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Mike decided that it was time for WordPress events to have a WordPress based solution for event management. And so he set to work creating GatherPress, which is the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike talks about the way events are currently managed, and why he thinks it&#8217;s time to transition to something more home grown. He thinks that GatherPress represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the event planning and participation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the development journey of GatherPress, discussing its current features, and the advantages he feels it offers to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also examine GatherPress&#8217; capacity to enable event coordination, and foster meaningful community engagement. He&#8217;s envisioning a future where event management built on top of WordPress is a hallmark of the WordPress event experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the roadmap features that are just around the corner, as well as chatting about the community which has grown up around the plugin, and how that community is looking for people to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a WordPress event organizer, or have attended a meetup in the past and are curious about how this could be handled by a freely available plugin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WP Tavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay, I bring you Mike Auteri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mike Auteri. How are you doing, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Hey, how&#8217;s it going, Nathan? How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very well, thank you. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today, really appreciate it. We are going to be talking a little bit today about a plugin, possibly a community, possibly the replacement of a service. Let&#8217;s find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are recording it at the end of January, 2024. In fact, on January the 23rd. This is a significant date, as you&#8217;ll hear a little bit later in the podcast. We&#8217;re going to be talking about meetups, and WordPress events, and the organisation thereof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, before we begin, just to give some context to who you are. You don&#8217;t have to go into the weeds of the plugin that we&#8217;re going to be talking about, but if you just want to give us a little bit of backstory, tell us your relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure. Currently I work for a company called Penske Media. I&#8217;ve been there for almost nine years, I&#8217;m an associate director of engineering there. I got into WordPress years and years and years ago. Maybe not as long as some folks, but I would say around 2008, is when I started dabbling with WordPress, mostly building some people&#8217;s sites in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, I was more of a front end developer. And I would say in like 2012, I think, I switched over to working in WordPress professionally, for media companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Okay, so the topic under discussion today is something called GatherPress. Now it may be a good idea, right at the top of the show, to ask you to pause, and go to GatherPress.org. It&#8217;s exactly as you&#8217;d expect it to be spelled, but I&#8217;ll do it at anyway. G-A-T-H-E-R-P-R-E-S-S.org GatherPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you will find most of the things that we&#8217;re going to talk about today. It is, if you like, it&#8217;s a possible replacement for something called Meetup, which is a SaaS service. You can find that at meetup.com. And if you&#8217;ve ever attended a WordPress, let&#8217;s say not WordCamp necessarily, but a more local meetup event, something like that. It&#8217;s quite likely that you have collided with the Meetup platform, because it&#8217;s typically how things are organised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Meetup, coincidentally I think, came into the news over the last few weeks, because they have been acquired by a company. And at the point of acquisition of a company, I think users often question, what&#8217;s going on there? What will the future look like for that? But I&#8217;m guessing, I have a suspicion, more than a suspicion, that you&#8217;ve been thinking about stepping away from Meetup as a solution for organising events for a time, because GatherPress has a history much longer than just the last few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, if, like me, you are not an organiser of events, but you&#8217;ve collided with Meetup just as somebody that signs up, so that you can actually register for events, tell us a little bit about it, and why you feel that maybe a plugin for the WordPress ecosystem is possibly a preferred solution to SaaS product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that&#8217;s a funny question. I&#8217;ve been a meetup organiser since 2017, and I really got my foot in the door, and there&#8217;s a whole other story of when I changed my career. If you look me up on YouTube, you could probably find a whole talk on that. But Meetup is the reason why I am where I am today, by the networking and finding very, very talented folks, that kind of became cheerleaders for me as I tried to make it in as a software engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But years ago when I was an organiser, one of the folks that attended said, why don&#8217;t we just build something on WordPress? And at that time I thought it was blasphemy, I&#8217;m like, that would never work. We need discoverability for a meetup, no one would ever find us, that just can&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Couple years later, a little thing called the dashboard widget appeared in WordPress, which started promoting meetups and WordCamps. And I&#8217;ll tell you like, once that hit WordPress, our numbers went through the roof. People were finding us left and right through the dashboard widget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the reasons why I think, for the last couple years, we could have been able to move off of Meetup, or at least been less reliant on it, is because of that dashboard widget. Most of the folks that I speak to, that attend to our meetups, find us through the dashboard widget. Less of them find us through meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that&#8217;s anecdotal, and I&#8217;m sure there is data to back this up that I don&#8217;t have, but I&#8217;ve spoken to other organisers, and I hear similar stories, that I think we get higher quality folks. And what I mean by that is people that actually show up, that sign up and show up to a meetup from the dashboard widget, than we do from the discoverability of meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really credible answer. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got anything more you want to add, but certainly that does help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;ll stay with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so I guess we should paint some context around that. So Meetup is in no way connected with WordPress, other than the fact that it is used by the WordPress community. You don&#8217;t have to have a WordPress event in order to use Meetup. It could be for literally any kind of event. You can sign up as anybody out there, and set up any kind of event. So your local history council, or something like that could be using Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I suppose, back in the day, there was almost like this SEO piece, where you wanted discoverability, you wanted the fact that your local meetup was going to be taking place this Tuesday to be announced globally. And shouting into the void was very hard, and so having people come through a platform where they&#8217;ve already signed up, and they&#8217;ve already got themselves an account, and the platform knew more about where they lived and all that was quite useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it sounds like what you are saying is, that because it&#8217;s a generic platform, and you could be signed up for all sorts of reasons, people might have signed up to the actual event on Tuesday, or Thursday, or whatever, you know, next month, that actual real world event. But then didn&#8217;t kind of follow through, because they really weren&#8217;t in the WordPress ecosystem, they just collided with it by accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then this dashboard widget comes along. Every single instance of WordPress has it, whether it&#8217;s visible or not is up to you. But it says, you know, it tells you what&#8217;s going on and where. And maybe there&#8217;s more of a hot lead feel to those people, because they&#8217;re actually interacting with WordPress, not just the platform. Have I encapsulated that about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:39] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I kind of get in the head of someone that would see the dashboard widget. You think about someone that just started their business, and put up their WordPress site and they&#8217;re like, now what? And they&#8217;re sitting in the admin, not sure what to do next. And the first thing they see is a meetup that is meeting next week, that&#8217;s like a mile away from their house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is powerful. Thinking like, wow, I can get help, because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here. And we see a lot of folks like that. They come to, especially our help desks, a lot of DIY people. People that are starting businesses. They&#8217;re not sure how to get started, but they see that dashboard widget. And that was an incredible addition to WordPress, and to expanding our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the Meetup platform has really great uses. You know, this is not an exercise in taking Meetup apart. It&#8217;s more an exercise in, well, given that there&#8217;s a bunch of software engineers behind the WordPress project, and there&#8217;s a plugin architecture, why not explore the options to create it inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that really is what GatherPress is aiming to do. It&#8217;s aiming to give you, dear listener, the opportunity to download a plugin, and organise your meeting within your WordPress admin. And now obviously you could set up a, you know, a unique domain, or you could set up something in a website that you already have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, do you just want to run through, maybe the more philosophical position, the open source position? Why do you feel it&#8217;s a good idea to have this as a plugin? What is it that you feel it brings as a plugin, as opposed to the service which we&#8217;ve been using until now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:11] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure. You know, we&#8217;re kind of alluding to it. You know, WordPress is an open source community, and has some incredibly talented folks. And this isn&#8217;t really breaking new ground in a lot of ways. There are event management plugins out there, there are plenty of them, and some of them have whole businesses around their event management plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I am after though, is one that stays true to the WordPress community&#8217;s roadmap of what they would want to see for an event management plugin. Meetup is the odd one out, when you think of the infrastructure that is of the WordPress community. If you look at wordpress.org, wordcamp.org, wordpress.tv, even wordpress.com, they&#8217;re all powered by WordPress. They&#8217;re all services. They&#8217;re all supporting the community using the software that we work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odd one out is meetup.com, and there was a reason for it originally. And there is still a reason to have it there now, but I think we could start exploring the idea of, what if meetups were powered by WordPress? What are the advantages? And I feel like there are lots of advantages. Think about, you mentioned with meetup.com before is, it&#8217;s very general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&#8217;re being more specific with say, a community run multi-site, if you think of like how WordCamps function, a large WordPress multi-site, that.org stands up. If we did the same thing for Meetup, we could promote other meetups within meetups. We can promote WordCamps within meetups, say in sidebars. We can promote learning materials. We have full control over the content, and how it&#8217;s placed, and where it&#8217;s placed, in order to best educate and help the folks that are landing on this type of meetup page that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, and what they know is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;d be able to really draw people into the WordPress community a lot sooner, by using something that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, as opposed to something on meetup.com, where they think, maybe, the WordPress community goes as far as their local meetup. They won&#8217;t know that like, right off the bat, that WordPress is global, that WordCamps are huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to like WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe, these are very, very large. Like especially when people only have a local view, and they&#8217;re like, oh yeah, WordCamp US, that&#8217;s three hours from my house, I think I&#8217;ll go. People are amazed at how large, and how extensive the community is. By being able to do something that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, we&#8217;d be able to do that a lot sooner for those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Has your North Star, whilst you&#8217;ve been creating this, been more or less direct replacement for the feature set that Meetup offers? I guess what I&#8217;m introducing here is, tell us a little bit about the functionality that you have shipped thus far. We can get onto roadmap features and things like that in the future. I was curious if the intention of the GatherPress plugin and project, is to literally have a replacement for meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, is the WordPress meetup format the North Star? You know, the intention is it&#8217;ll achieve all of those things. But it&#8217;s not intended to be a more general plugin for anybody else. You know, it&#8217;s specifically created to replicate live events for WordPress. What you&#8217;re thinking there, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I absolutely used meetup.com as an example. They&#8217;ve been doing this for years, so I want to make sure that we had the features, especially the important features that matter to the WordPress community as far as I could tell. Because, like I said, I&#8217;ve been a WordPress meetup organiser since 2017. Making sure that all those features are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I think of myself as a WordPress organiser, I&#8217;m like, okay, if I was to do something powered by WordPress, what would this thing need to do, in order for me to be like, yeah, I could use this instead of meetup.com? So I kind of use that as my starting place. And as I mentioned before, like, we started working on this in 2019. And it&#8217;s kind of evolved since then. It&#8217;s not really the same thing it was when it started. I would say it probably became stable about two years ago of like, okay, this is exactly what we&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve had other folks that have jumped onto the project, and giving their insights as well. Some as, you know, people that attended meetups, some people that were also organisers, and trying to build the feature set that we would expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we started this, blocks were pretty new. Like I said, 2019, so blocks were still pretty new at that point. And I wanted to build this to be very forward thinking, and be like, this is going to leverage all the great stuff that has been coming out of core around blocks, making it easy for folks to come in and use the GatherPress blocks in order to RSVP, see a list of people that have RSVP&#8217;d. Add to calendar block, a specific date block for scheduling. All these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also looked at the event manager plugin, as another idea of that&#8217;s a popular, not quite exactly what I was looking at, but still an event management plugin. And seeing the ways they translated these things into WordPress, and took what I thought would be a good user interface. And, you know, between the two of those, started building GatherPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you mentioned there, blocks. So, is that the primary interface for interacting? You set up a post, or a page, or whatever it may be, and you&#8217;re dragging blocks in, which I guess are adjacent to certain features. So you may drag one in that is a GatherPress block, and it asks you for, you know, when do you want to put this event on? Where exactly is it located? And all that kind of stuff. And then it will present that data on the front end. Have I got that roughly correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:49] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah, roughly, like we make it a little bit easier with block templates, for the event itself. So, I mean, granted you can, you know, move the blocks around all you want, but it&#8217;ll start you off with a block placement that makes sense. So someone that is a little less savvy, will know where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have, in addition to events, we also have the ability to add and create venues, and tie those venues to the events. All of those are post types, venues actually, a mixture of a post type and a taxonomy. I won&#8217;t get into the technical aspect of that, but it&#8217;s pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have various settings within the GatherPress plugin to customise how you want your event to look. And I have to hand it to Patricia, she played a huge role in this, because I came at this from a very American point of view. And she was mentioning to me, I want to change the date format. I&#8217;m like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we start building settings for changing date formats and, you know, exploring all the different ways we need to translate the plugin. And we actually translated into a few languages already, which is pretty cool. And a lot of it was helped from her and Javier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the intention really is for non-technical users to be able to download the plugin, follow some basic data entry, you know, dates, times, map locations, that kind of thing. Perhaps internationalise it in some way, and then click publish and you&#8217;re off to the races. You&#8217;ll have something on the front end that people can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess you&#8217;ve got two markets for this. You&#8217;ve got to be thinking about how the people wishing to attend the event are going to be interacting, and what you&#8217;ll do with that data. But you&#8217;ve also got to make sure it&#8217;s nice and straightforward for the people who are organising the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s talk about those two different roles a little bit. What features do you bring, let&#8217;s begin with the, I&#8217;m an event organiser. What features do you bring to enable me to do that? You know, you mentioned these blocks, and that you can say what the title of the event is, and bind it to a location, and all of that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But does it offer me functionality to, for example, see a list of who&#8217;s signed up for this particular event, see a list of who&#8217;s cancelled? I don&#8217;t know, in some way communicate with them, email the people who have responded, but haven&#8217;t got involved in that event yet. All those kind of things that we might see in a dedicated SaaS app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure, yeah. So a few of those features are in their infancy. Like, one of our big things was, what do we need for a minimum viable product for this plugin? So we&#8217;ve been focusing on that. So some of this stuff isn&#8217;t quite there yet, but a lot of it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, so for instance, an RSVP response block. So if you go to the event, and you are logged in, you can click on the RSVP button, and say you&#8217;re attending. Once you click on that attending, in real time, it shows you that you are now in the attendance list. Kind of like how Meetup functions, in a lot of ways. So if you go to meetup.com, a new event is there, you say, yeah, I&#8217;m going to go, and you click attend, now you&#8217;re on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everybody can see that you are now attending. You would also change it to be not attending, and you will then be in a list of folks that are not attending, if you change your mind and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody&#8217;s able to see that. These are all different blocks that are within the event post type. They also tie in with some, getting a little bit more technical, tie into database tables and such, in order to store that data. So they&#8217;re not stored in the block, they&#8217;re stored in the database, and are represented in that block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have not added a feature yet to it, but this is in our next release. We&#8217;re currently at 0.27. In 0.28, we are working on an admin interface, for an administrator to be able to remove or add people to a list, like automatically from that block. We have not finished that yet, but that is in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also adding a feature, so if people can list themselves anonymously that they&#8217;re attending. So if they don&#8217;t want their name or profile photo to show up, they can be anonymous. They&#8217;ll be anonymous to everybody other than administrators, administrators will know who&#8217;s showing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not a feature of meetup.com, but that is a feature that folks that I&#8217;ve heard from in the WordPress community, actually I think Courtney was one of the ones that mentioned it. Some people want to just show up and not, you know, people to know who they are. And we do have that feature also in WordCamps, for folks that don&#8217;t want to be shown as listed, that they&#8217;re attending a WordCamp for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you attend a WordCamp, like WordCamp US, one of the options at the point of purchasing the ticket is to, I guess it&#8217;s the same thing. It&#8217;s not really anonymous in the same way, but you just don&#8217;t appear on the website. You just decline to be on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. So in GatherPress, and it&#8217;s kind of the same way, instead of a display name, it&#8217;ll say anonymous. And instead of a photo, it&#8217;ll show like a, you know, the generic avatar listed. So it will show that someone is attending, but it won&#8217;t show who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. You&#8217;re able as the administrator of the event, the organiser of the event, to communicate with these people? Is there a fairly straight forward way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:37] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. So we do have, and this is, again, still in its infancy, we have the ability to compose messages, and send to people in the community. You can have a couple of check boxes that say, contact all members, people that are attending, people that are on the wait list, we do have a wait list feature, and people that are not attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So between these check boxes, you can click on a button that pulls up a modal in the admin, write your message, hit send, and that&#8217;ll send out an email to the designated folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you don&#8217;t mind me sort of interrupting that point, how are you handling email? Do you have connections with certain SMTP services, or is that just something else you have to handle elsewhere, possibly with a plugin? And do you queue the emails so they go in batches, or, what&#8217;s the intention there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:21] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So it&#8217;s using wp_mail, which is the, you know, underneath the layer of everything is kind of a generic email. By default you will use PHP mail. You can use the WP SMTP plugin, which we are using on gatherpress.org, to set it up with a certain service in order to have deliverability, what you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I am always thinking about, with this plugin in particular, it&#8217;s like we don&#8217;t want to do too much. There&#8217;s plenty of plugins that do a thing better than we would do it. And we should use those plugins, verses trying to duplicate a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, one of my other thoughts is like, say BuddyPress. BuddyPress has a lot of community features to it. It would be great to use GatherPress and BuddyPress, and making sure the two play nice together, and integrate well together. And not have things in GatherPress do things that BuddyPress could do better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same instance, we just want to send emails. And whatever service you want to use, a plugin to handle your service, that&#8217;s what you should do. And we&#8217;re not going to be too opinionated about that. We will just make sure that we send it through WP Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, yeah. But in terms of the administration of the event, do you have options to, I don&#8217;t know, recycle events? So you&#8217;ve run a very successful event, everything that you&#8217;d set up on a previous event checked out, you&#8217;re really happy with the way it was. Have you got options to, more or less, duplicate that event, and carry on from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Currently that&#8217;s on the roadmap. Being able to have a recurring event is, we do have a ticket in our backlog that did not make it into the MVP, because that, as you can imagine, is a bit more complicated. I do have a plan for it. So I do have an architecture and plan that I&#8217;m putting together. But it is not in the core plugin yet. Currently, like, for say, our current GatherPress events, I think it&#8217;s called Duplicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Duplicate Post, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:11] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Duplicate Post, yeah. I just use that, because we have the same weekly huddle. Every week I just clone it, put in the new date, and publish. So it&#8217;s one more step than having something that would be recurring. But it&#8217;s not that bad, and that kind of works for now. And that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re using until that feature is built. And that is definitely on our roadmap though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Lovely. And of course, we know what happened during the last four years or so. Covid came, all the events went away, and we were forced into Zoom and online events. And some of those are still happening, some of the events haven&#8217;t come back in the real world. Is there any options in there to, you know, not use the map and to, I don&#8217;t know, bind it to a Zoom link and an online event, something along those lines?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Absolutely. So that was absolutely in our MVP, because we were building this during Covid, so that was front and center of our thinking. And a lot of time went into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our venue options, so if you&#8217;re creating an event, an online event is automatically there, since an online event is just an online event, and it doesn&#8217;t require a map, it doesn&#8217;t require any specifics, it&#8217;s just online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you select that, it gives you an option to add, say, a Zoom link, or Google Meet, or Teams, or whatever you&#8217;re hosting your online meetup at. A recent feature we put into this is that the online link, or the Zoom link, or whatever it is, will not be available until five minutes before the event starts. So you don&#8217;t have people like jumping in there when they&#8217;re not supposed to be, and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was a feature we added, that&#8217;s actually not on Meetup. Meetup, you see that online link. But we added a feature that will kind of hide the event link. And when I mean hide, I mean hide hide, like it&#8217;s not in APIs and any of that fun stuff. So it&#8217;s pretty well, behind closed doors at that point. But it becomes available once you&#8217;re logged in, and five minutes before the event. That&#8217;s kind of how we set it for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So as an admin, all of that makes perfect sense. It sounds really straightforward and simple. There are some videos, by the way, on the GatherPress website. So you can go and check out the UI, and everything we&#8217;ve just described is there, visible for you to see, there&#8217;s a nice run through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, from the end user&#8217;s point of view, the person who&#8217;s attending the event, I guess it&#8217;s just a case of discovering the website, going there, entering an email address, and confirming a link, or something like that. And of course, given that your block is showing data, I guess you can, as the admin, you can modify where that&#8217;s displayed. And you can pad it with other content with different blocks, you know, if you want to add something before it and after it, you can do all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is that basically it? I show up to your website, I enter an email address, and from that point on, I&#8217;m expecting email to arrive, and then to attend the event itself. Can that happen online, if it is an online event? Do you have the option to do that? Or, have you got to go your own way there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:01] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> The way it would function, from an end user&#8217;s point of view, if you came onto the site and you&#8217;re not logged in, it will ask you to either log in or register for the site. So one of the things with a GatherPress site, if it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re trying to attract the public to, you&#8217;ll have to, you know, check the box that says anybody can register for the site. And there is a notification when you install the plugin to say, hey, you might want to do this, you know, turn this on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once that&#8217;s turned on, if you, Nathan, were to come to the GatherPress site, you would then register. You know, like I said, we try not to be too opinionated. WordPress allows registration, WordPress allows login, so we&#8217;re going to leverage the default behavior of how WordPress functions there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we&#8217;re going to look to extend on that, if people want a more, a different kind of look and feel for that. But, at the bare bones, we want people to be able to register and log in, like any other WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re logged in, it&#8217;ll take you back. You know, once you create an account, you can go back to that event. You click RSVP, then you can say, I&#8217;m attending this, and you click the attend button. And now you&#8217;re on the list of people that are attending, and you&#8217;ll, you know, if the organiser sends out an email to those attending, you&#8217;ll receive that email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And should I wish to unsubscribe, is there options there? You know, I&#8217;m thinking GDPR, and all those kind of things. If I wish to no longer receive the emails, all of that, that&#8217;s taken care of, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:22] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that is not. I need to work on that piece. One of the things we were looking to do with integration with BuddyPress was, BuddyPress has those options to turn off notifications. So leveraging that aspect of BuddyPress, but GatherPress will have to do a bare minimum for that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So you have to login to each event&#8217;s website. So let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a WordPress meetup in the UK. There might be one in Bristol, there might be one in Brighton, and London, and Manchester, and all these other different places. I would need to go and make an account on each of those websites, should they choose to use GatherPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess one of the benefits of meetup.com was that you just had this one sign up, which was kind of nice. I&#8217;m wondering around there, do you have any intuitions or thoughts on federating that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:04] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that&#8217;s exactly what our proposal was. So our proposal is, if you think of it how WordCamps function, right? That they&#8217;re on a multi-site. So multi-sites use the same user database, right? What we would ideally want folks to use in this is, what they would log into wordpress.org with, so their profile, the wordpress.org profile, and utilise that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a multi-site powered, you know, with the event management powered by GatherPress, if you went to any of those meetups and they&#8217;re on that multi-site, it would be the same login for all of them. So then you&#8217;d be able to log into all of those different sites, and be able to say, I&#8217;m attending this, and it&#8217;s all the same user, it&#8217;s your WordPress profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that then something you are hoping to put together in terms of infrastructure and maintenance thereof? A multi-site network where you can sign up as an admin, and bag brighton.gatherpress.com, or whatever it might be. And therefore you can federate that account login, and presumably therefore you could distribute, you could create another dashboard widget, which had all of the events that were in that multi-site network, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:08] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Right. So the idea is like, we&#8217;ve been talking and working with the meta team already. So like I&#8217;ve had conversations with say like Ian Dunn. He seemed pretty into the idea of setting up another network, kind of how we have with WordCamps, but with meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And setting up that network that would leverage the same sort of infrastructure that we are already kind of used to with wordpress.org and wordcamp.org, and be able to host those meetups in a multi-site, that have opted in to start using this new platform. Then being able to use their WordPress profile to log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there was also kind of some, you know, chat and thought about like, maybe someone should explore a single sign on with Meetup credentials, for people that still find it through Meetup. So if they already have Meetup credentials, maybe they can leverage that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But trying to remove a lot of the friction, where we can, is a big thing like, you and I both know like, you don&#8217;t want a million logins, and I don&#8217;t want a million logins to all different meetups. We want to keep that as simple as possible, and as straightforward as possible. Because the success of a project like this relies on people being able to easily create a, like, you know, have an account, or create one account, and be able to go to all those different WordPress meetups in that multi-site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think so. I think there&#8217;s something more likely to get off the ground, if there&#8217;s just one login. And then you can actually see, I don&#8217;t know, you could go as far as putting a map of the world up and, put pins in it based upon the events that are happening in the next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:33] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> The events page already, the events.wordpress, I think it&#8217;s events.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m blanking right now, but that has like all the different events that are happening. That was put together, I guess a couple months ago. But it was one of the reasons I started pushing forward on this, being like, hey, we are starting to use WordPress infrastructure for our events more seriously. This is a project I&#8217;ve been leading for the last couple years to help with that initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m looking at the documentation page, and helpfully there&#8217;s, obviously the documentation on the page itself, but you&#8217;ve got some links for users, you know, poeple who just wish to try out the plugin. But also developers, presumably if they wish to extend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a GitHub repository. All of this will be linked to in the show notes for this podcast. So if you go to wptavern.com, and look for the podcast episode associated with this, you&#8217;ll be able to find all of that there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also at the bottom, you&#8217;ve got a list of upcoming features. Now, I know that you&#8217;ve touched on a few of these, but if you just want list out what&#8217;s not been mentioned so far, if you can remember. And yeah, what&#8217;s in the roadmap for the near future, I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:36] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> One of the big things that people, you know, I&#8217;ve thought of and people have confirmed, especially moving something like this is like, well, what about all the events I have on meetup.com? Like, how can I migrate those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the thoughts, like I mentioned, I&#8217;m very thoughtful about what goes into the core plugin for GatherPress. And anything that is kind of like, well, that&#8217;s specific to this, right? Say, if you&#8217;re migrating from meetup.com to GatherPress, you&#8217;d want some functionality to be able to do that easily and seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not everybody using GatherPress, so I don&#8217;t see that as a core feature of the plugin, but I do see that as a companion plugin. So that&#8217;s going to be our first, what we call companion plugin, called GatherPress Meetup Importer. And what that will do is take an API key from meetup.com, and be able to import the meetups that you&#8217;ve had already, on Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since, like I mentioned, a lot of the features from meetup.com to GatherPress were close to apples to apples, we&#8217;d be able to take that data, and put it in the right spot for GatherPress. And then maybe running an ongoing job, so if you were, say, I want to be able to still use meetup.com to first publish, and have GatherPress ingest it as I go through, like kind of a trial and transition. We want to be able to have folks be able to do that too. And maybe like direct traffic to their GatherPress site, while still maintaining, for at least the time being, their presence on meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s one of our first plugins that, you know, we&#8217;ve started on. I&#8217;ve been testing it, works great. There&#8217;s another plugin that does this already, and we&#8217;re kind of using that as a model, for building one that&#8217;s very specific and very, all the features are specific to GatherPress is kind of what we&#8217;re after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll just list off a couple of other things that are mentioned here. So I&#8217;ve got the ability for attendees to be listed anonymously, you mentioned that. Allow attendees to add guests. That&#8217;s nice. Import events, that&#8217;s the one you&#8217;ve just mentioned. Recurring events, so rather than duplicating the posts, there&#8217;ll be something built in, different functionality. A calendar block, presumably to show the events in a way that you might look at your Google calendar or something, you see it by date. And this is nice, probably underestimated how important it is, the email notification when the events start. I think that&#8217;s really crucial, especially if it&#8217;s a live event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:52] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Right now I just compose, and say starting five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Easy to forget though. And you never know how many people you are sort of leaving behind, if that notification fails to go out. So that&#8217;s really nice. But also, the bit that I alluded to at the beginning, right at the beginning when I said that the date was the 23rd of January, comes now because, Patricia, that you mentioned, and I&#8217;ll link to this in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a pilot program, which you launched by pure coincidence, yesterday. So 22nd of Jan 2024. What is the community pilot program? What&#8217;s its intention? Who are you trying to get on board? Just tell us a little bit about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:25] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure, yeah. So that is the project that I mentioned about, building something into the wordpress.org infrastructure that powers meetups. So much like, you know, the meta team is behind the wordcamp.org, or wordpress.tv, or just wordpress.org. We want to have another multi-site in that network, for meetup events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re pushing for GatherPress to be the community plugin, that does the event management for that particular infrastructure. We have some meetups, and some more that have even responded to the proposal saying like, yeah, we&#8217;d love to be part of that pilot program too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a couple that are in the US, I think five that are in Switzerland, and some in Spain, that would love to be part of this pilot program, where we put this multi-site together. Each site on that multi-site is a meetup group. And then they start using that in tandem with meetup.com, in order to start driving more events around, within this WordPress powered event system. And starting to slowly move off meetup.com, and seeing how it goes. You know, see if something like that would be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;re after community members. And just before we end the podcast, in a moment, I&#8217;ll ask for your contact details, and what have you. If you go to gatherpress.org, the way that I&#8217;m seeing about the community program, is because it is the most recent blog post, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking at what looks like an archive of blog posts. But I noticed that the archive of blog posts is probably in some way using GatherPress itself, because I&#8217;ve got these RSVP buttons, and if I click into the GatherPress weekly huddle, I notice that I&#8217;ve got add to calendar links, and I&#8217;ve got an RSVP button, which invokes a modal. Is that GatherPress in action?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:08] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> That is GatherPress in action. Anybody can join. 11:00 am Eastern Standard Time. We have our GatherPress weekly huddle, and that&#8217;s when the team gets together. Any folks that are interested in GatherPress, there&#8217;s a Zoom link. It&#8217;s an online event. And we have that every week on Fridays. So Friday, 11:00 am, Eastern Time, we have those every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And if you go to gatherpress.org, you&#8217;ll be able to see them, well, as the page currently stands you can see them, and obviously the most recent one in this case rises to the top. So you can just scroll down a little way, and click the button to RSVP, and get yourself set up in that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> You can click through and see more event details. But, yeah, that is another block that we have for pages, called Event List. That will show various events, whether past or upcoming. So that&#8217;s another feature of GatherPress as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve thought of everything. Brilliant. Okay, just before we knock it on the head then, Mike, I think probably some people listening to this will be in tune with what you&#8217;re saying, and hopefully will wish to reach out to you, to find out more about the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, they could go to the website, that&#8217;s a given. If they want to contact you personally, or in more personal way, do you have a social network handle that you hang out on, or an email address that you&#8217;re willing to give out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Twitter&#8217;s a good one. It&#8217;s M Auteri, M-A-U-T-E-R-I. So my first initial and my last name, you can find us there. If you send me a DM, and we have a GatherPress Slack. We also have a GatherPress Twitter, which we&#8217;re starting to use a little bit more, now that we&#8217;ve gone a little bit more public with it. And that is just GatherPress. So if you find GatherPress on Twitter, spelled exactly as it is on the website. You can follow us there. You know, we just started using that Twitter account, so I don&#8217;t even know if it has any followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. There&#8217;s also, in the main navigation of the gatherpress.org website, there&#8217;s an item entitled Get Involved. And if you click over there, you&#8217;ll be able to see a contact form, plus the GatherPress Slack group link is there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:59] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah, I think Mervin added that like yesterday, so that all brand new stuff, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is all shiny and new, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s lovely. The feeling that you get from these brand new products is so engaging, and I really hope that you managed to keep the momentum going. It sounds like you&#8217;ve got a lot of interest in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:16] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah We&#8217;ve been keeping that momentum going. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Thank so much for chatting to us about GatherPress today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:22] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauteri\">Mike Auteri</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike is an Associate Director of Engineering at Penske Media Corporation, as well as the founder and engineering lead of the <a href=\"https://gatherpress.org/\">GatherPress project</a>. He’s contributed code to WordPress Core and Gutenberg, is a WordPress community team supporter, has written plugins, presented at meetups and WordCamps, and is a co-organiser of the WordPress Montclair Meetup in New Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve attended a WordPress meetup event, it’s quite likely that you registered for that via the meetup.com platform. It’s become the defacto way for organisers of events to plan their meetups, send out invites, subscribe users, and promote future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Mike decided that it was time for WordPress events to have a WordPress based solution for event management, and so he set to work creating GatherPress, which is the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike talks about the way events are currently managed and why he thinks it’s time to transition to something more home-grown. He thinks that GatherPress represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the event planning and participation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the development journey of GatherPress, discussing its current features and the advantages he feels it offers to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also examine GatherPress&#8217;s capacity to enable event coordination and foster meaningful community engagement. He’s envisioning a future where event management built on top of WordPress is a hallmark of the WordPress event experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the roadmap features that are just around the corner, as well as chatting about the community which has grown up around the plugin, and how that community is looking for people to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a WordPress event organiser, or have attended a meetup in the past and are curious about how this could be handled by a freely available plugin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pmc.com/\">Penske Media Corporation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">meetup.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gatherpress.org/\">GatherPress plugin website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/\">GatherPress GitHub repository</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/01/22/proposal-pilot-program-to-test-gatherpress-on-the-wordpress-org-network-as-a-meetup-alternative/\">Proposal: Pilot program to test GatherPress on the WordPress.org network as a Meetup alternative</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauteri\">Mike&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gatherpress.slack.com/\">GatherPress Slack group</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatherpress\">GatherPress Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.4.3 – Maintenance and Security release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/wordpress-6-4-3-maintenance-and-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7054:\"<p>This security and maintenance release features <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&component=!Bundled+Theme&id=!59828&milestone=6.4.3&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=version&col=keywords&order=priority\">5 bug fixes on Core</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/5698#issuecomment-1909302298\">16 bug fixes for the Block Editor</a>, and 2 security fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because this is a security release, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.</strong> Backports are also available for other major WordPress releases, 4.1 and later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.4.3.zip\">download WordPress 6.4.3 from WordPress.org</a>, or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”.

Just kidding. But we did introduce a concept into Automattic that I think will provide a lot of clarity for the teams within Automattic, and hopefully for the broader WordPress ecosystem that works and partners with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is there&#8217;s a game, each person gets a card: Be the Host, Help the Host, or Neutral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot change cards during the course of your day or week. If you do not feel aligned with your card, you need to change divisions within Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re Be the Host, you are hyper-competitive. You are trying to make the case to a customer for why they should host with you and not consider anyone else. This is what everyone assumes all of Automattic is, but it&#8217;s actually just one sub-division, which is a minority of our revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Help the Hosts, your word is <strong>ecosystem</strong>. You plant the seeds of open source software that grow everywhere. Every WordPress is precious to you, wherever it grew up. You want every host to be as successful as possible, because the real threat is from the Big Proprietary folks outside, who steal all your good ideas and don’t let you touch them again. You want to get to know every WordPress in the world, however it grew up, and help it out by selling it attachments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neutral treats everyone equally, either because they don&#8217;t care (Day One, Pocket Casts, et cetera don&#8217;t have a horse in this race) or because they are a support function like finance or HR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you meet or talk to an Automattician you can ask what their card is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, WordPress.com is going to orient itself more towards developers, and have an experience that feels similar to WordPress hosted other places, less Calypso more wp-admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big tension this surfaced was Woo Express, going forward that team is switching under WP.com, and Woo.com will recommend a variety of hosts (like W.org) to get started with Woo. Now people can meet with Paul Maiorana, who leads Woo, or James Grierson, who leads Jetpack, and know they have Help the Hosts cards as their teleological goal.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 28 Jan 2024 20:08:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Freedom Grants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=110880\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2024/01/freedom-grants/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:729:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://audrey.co/scholars/\">Audrey Scholars program</a> is still getting started, but I wanted to introduce another opportunity: <a href=\"https://audrey.co/freedom-grants/\">Freedom grants</a>.

It&#8217;s never easy. For my personal life as well as for web development, when I am entrenched in the minutia of change, and it drags me down, I stop and get to a higher level and reminder myself about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi\">Wabi Sabi</a> and marvel at the impermanence, the imperfections and the incomplete state of things and of life, really.

My name. Is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, advocating for accessibility and diversity in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Michelle Frechette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to sound like a lot, and that&#8217;s because it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette is the director of community engagement for StellarWP at Liquid Web. She was called the busiest woman in WordPress by Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp US 2022. She is also the host of the WP Coffee Talk Podcast, co-founder of Underrepresented in Tech creator of WP Speakers and WP Career Pages, president of the board for Big Orange Heart, Director of Community Relations and contributor at Post Status, co-host of the WP Motivate and Audacity Marketing Podcasts, host of the WP Constellations Podcast, author, and frequent organizer and speaker at WordPress events. Michelle lives outside of Rochester, New York, where she&#8217;s an avid nature photographer. You can learn more about Michelle at meetmichelle.online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, like I said, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This willingness to engage in all manner of WordPress projects has given Michelle a voice. And she&#8217;s on the podcast today to discuss a topic which is close to her heart. Diversity equity, inclusion and belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She talks about her experiences at WordPress events, and how they were not always easy for her to attend and be a part of. Michelle uses a scooter to get around, and there have been situations in which she could not enter venues and access all the facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This frustration made her take action, and, as you&#8217;ll hear, effect change at subsequent event she attended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about events though. Michelle talks about the wider goals of making all aspects of the WordPress community more open and inclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being one of the voices promoting this message has not always been easy. And we hear about how Michelle copes with those who disagree with her quest to create change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in thinking about inclusivity and how embracing diverse perspectives can impact the WordPress community, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Michelle Frechette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Michelle Frechette. Hello Michelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hi Nathan, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am very good. Michelle has been called the busiest woman in WordPress, I think that&#8217;s the right wording, by Matt Mullenweg. And if I was to read out her bio, which I&#8217;m not going to do, I&#8217;ll let Michelle introduce herself. You would have some understanding of why that happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to give you an opportunity right at the beginning, you can go as deep as you like, Michelle. Give us your bio, give us your story about your relationship with WordPress, and the different projects that you are in, before we begin our conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So my day job, I always feel like a superhero when I say that. By day I am the Director of Community Engagement for StellarWP, and all of our plugins and themes, that are part of that company at Liquid Web. And my external projects though, are the ones that I think you are more interested in talking about today, perhaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which are things like WP Career Pages, WP Speakers, and underrepresentedintech.com. So a lot of the side projects that I do, and the things that I do within the WordPress community, really are community oriented projects that are to help others find their footing and move forward in the work that they want to do within WordPress, and within the WordPress community. So I really enjoy doing those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How did you discover WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s a good story actually. It has to do with spaghetti. So actually, one of my best friends and I, we had started a nonprofit together. I was working at a massage school, as the director of the massage school. She was a massage therapist, and graduate of the program. And she came to me and she said, after a thousand hours of working in this program, you graduate, you take an exam, and then you&#8217;re just on your own spinning in the wind. Because you really have no idea how to build a business, how to get clientele, all of these things. You know how to do massage, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we started a nonprofit to help massage therapists actually have careers. So we did classes, we had, you know, meetings. We did all of these different things, special education and continuing education, those kinds of things. And so we decided we needed a website, and her husband was a WordPress developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he created this beautiful website for us. And so we started sending him content. And he&#8217;s like, hold up ladies, no. These are your logins, you log in and you put your content in. I built you the frame. Have fun. I was terrified. I like logged in and I thought, what button am I going to press that&#8217;s going to make the whole thing come crashing down? And I&#8217;m going to have to say to him, I broke this site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course that doesn&#8217;t happen really. So I remember putting information on the homepage, hitting update, and then quickly opening a new tab to see what happened, right? And the fact that there was all of these words that I just wrote, out there for the whole world to see. Nobody saw it, because nobody knew about the site at that particular moment. But the idea that they could, that somebody in Europe could open up this website, and see that I had put words out into the universe, was incredibly intoxicating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I started doing more and more with that site. I decided I could do this for a living, or at least for a side project. And so I contacted him and I said, okay, I understand how to use WordPress, and I understand how to buy a domain. What I don&#8217;t understand is, how do I have hosting in one spot and a domain in the other, and actually put those two things together so that I have a domain on the web?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, Christine&#8217;s working almost every night this week, if you come over and make spaghetti for the kids, because they had four kids, I will show you how to do WordPress. And so I went over there, the kids helped me. We made spaghetti, all of the things that go with the dinner like that. The kids cleaned up dinner. We sat down at his dining room table, opened up, and he showed me how to buy a domain, how to buy hosting, and then how to put WordPress on that hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I still had it. I had a little blue piece of paper that had four steps. The third step I remember was, change the salt keys. We don&#8217;t really do any of that anymore, right. But I remember doing that. And so from that, I started building websites for other people. I left higher education at some point and said, I think I could do this as a full-time job. Hung a shingle, figuratively. And within a few weeks I had so many clients that I was doing marketing for, and building websites for. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of like the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. The thing that I&#8217;ve noticed about you, apart from the fact that you&#8217;ve built websites, is you&#8217;re heavily, heavily involved in the WordPress community. And it can be quite a jump, going from WordPress user to WordPress community member. In fact, I&#8217;d go as far as saying that, you know, most people that have contact with WordPress, probably have absolutely no idea that there is a community of any description at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did that happen? How did it become such an integral part your life? How did you discover the community, events and so on? And how did it become the fulcrum of so much in your life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Same person. So, you know, shout out to Christine&#8217;s husband, Rob. But he said, hey, you know, we have this meetup in Rochester for WordPress users. And I said, okay. He said, well, this is the next one, this is where it is. And I showed up to that meetup. It was in a darkened room, because they had a slide projector, you know, overhead going so they could show what&#8217;s going on with this website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topic that day was Digital Ocean. I had no idea what was happening. And then they showed some CSS, and I was like CS what? And so I was the only woman, in a dark room filled with men, talking about things I had no concept of. And it took me two years to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two years, he had also said, look, you got to look at this thing called WordCamps. And so I went to WordCamp Buffalo, and I literally sat there all day learning from people whose names I had heard of but had never been, you know, in their presence. And thought for $25, I think at that time it was $20, I just got so much information, and lunch. You know, it was amazing. And so I thought that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the next year, Rob said, I can&#8217;t, first of all, he was organising meetups on a whim. Hey, we haven&#8217;t had one in a while, is everybody free next Tuesday? My brain can&#8217;t operate that way. It&#8217;s like, I need structure. So when he said, I can&#8217;t run this anymore, does anybody want to step in? I was like, me, I&#8217;ll do it, I&#8217;ll do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have regular meetups, at the same time every month. Same day, every month. And things got a little organised that way. I went to WordCamp US, and said to Andrea Middleton at the time, yeah, maybe someday we&#8217;ll have a Word camp in Rochester. And she said, why not this year? And so I was like, okay. So we had the first WordCamp Rochester.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was speaking at that time at different WordCamps all over New York and Canada, actually, eastern part of Canada. And things just kind of started to snowball from there, I guess, where I got asked to speak in more places. My name started to be recognised here and there, and I&#8217;m not a developer, so I was constantly surprised that people wanted to hear what I had to say. But that&#8217;s where I really started to learn that the majority of our community are WordPress users, not necessarily developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that it takes everybody in our ecosystem to make WordPress the product that it is today, and that you can be a marketer and contribute to WordPress. You can be an, you know, a community person, contribute to WordPress, and that it really takes everybody. If it was just software, without the rest of us, it would not be nearly what we are today as WordPress, and what we know as WordPress. So, yeah, I don&#8217;t know if I answered question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, that&#8217;s really interesting. There&#8217;s an awful lot that&#8217;s gone on. And you&#8217;ve obviously, right from the get go of finding WordPress decided that you wanted to, well, you had that 2 year hiatus, but after that you were in with both feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that there are some areas of the WordPress community that you&#8217;ve taken on as, well, crusade is the wrong word, but you&#8217;ve got issues which you think are important. And you&#8217;ve made them the focus and the fulcrum of what you do. And we&#8217;re going to get into some of these today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s, first of all, just introduce the acronym under discussion a lot today, and it&#8217;s the acronym DEIB. It may very well be that people have no idea what that means. So first of all, can we unpick that? What do those letters stand for, and how does it in any way go with WordPress and community, and all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So DEIB, the acronym itself stands for diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. And so the idea is that there are entire groups of underrepresented folks in any organisation, in any community. And those are going to be the people that are either minority groups of some sort or another, whether it&#8217;s racial, ethnic minority, whether it&#8217;s ability minority, whether it&#8217;s age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so many different ways that somebody can be in an underrepresented group, the LGBTQ+ community for example. And so, what DEIB activities try to do is kind of level the play field a little bit, and make sure that everybody has access to whatever the community is. So in our case, of course, WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not just access to WordPress, anybody can download WordPress, as long as you&#8217;re in a country that doesn&#8217;t restrict access. Of course, we know that that does exist too. But it&#8217;s more than just having access to the software, it&#8217;s having access to representation within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what we do at Underrepresented in Tech, what I&#8217;ve done with some of the other projects that I do, is really seek to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to be heard. Have a voice in the community. And see others like themselves on stages, in podcasts, writing for blogs, and CEO or C-suite positions, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we actually have a better community when it isn&#8217;t just one homogeneous group. I don&#8217;t know why that never rolls off my tongue right. But we don&#8217;t just have one group of people. In our case, you know, white, straight, males, who are running everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important, if we are going to have truly the best product that we could ever have, that different voices, different perspectives, different experiences help shape what that looks like going forward. And so DEIB really does, the DEIB movements and the things that we can do for that, is super important in order for us to have the best product ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of times you&#8217;ll hear it referred to just as DEI. A lot of companies have DEI. But the B part of it, that belonging part of it, that brings it from tokenisation to actually inclusion. That inclusive part of it is so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just enough that a CEO decides that they have a black person on the cover of their website, or on the cover of their brochure, and things like that to show, hey, look at us, we&#8217;re with it. We know what this is all about. Anybody can use a stock photo, but what do you really do? How are you really including people and how are you celebrating differences? That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t know what your experience is outside of WordPress in the recent past, but do you feel, do you have an intuition that the WordPress community is actually quite open to these kind of discussions? Do you sense that there&#8217;s an acceptance that this is an issue, which needs to be air and talked about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I can well imagine that in any community, there&#8217;s going to be people who think, well, you know what, the core thing is, for example, the code. That&#8217;s the thing that counts, so that&#8217;s what we should all concentrate on, and all these other things are not for me to worry about, and we don&#8217;t need to worry about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have this intuition that WordPress might be ahead of the curve on these kind of things, and addressing these issues, but, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:27] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think it&#8217;s grown over the last few years. So few years back, we had the first, what was originally called the all women&#8217;s release squad. And then it was the all women non-binary release. And at that point in time, lots of people got behind it. It was a wonderful thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s always a faction of people who grumble and say it&#8217;s not necessary. I think it was Joost de Valk posted in the Advanced WordPress Facebook Group, how exciting it was that this was all happening. And I think by the time they closed that thread, there were over 300 responses to that one post. The majority of which were negative, and then replies to those negative responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this was what, three years ago? It wasn&#8217;t that long ago. And so, to be able to look at that and say, wow, that many people, not just men, but majority men, were against having a release squad that was all women and non-binary folks. Saying that it couldn&#8217;t possibly be the best release that it ever could be, because men weren&#8217;t involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that, just because it was women and non-binary folks, that it would not be the best that it could be. And that&#8217;s just, that&#8217;s just rubbish, to use a British term. It&#8217;s rubbish. There are women and non-binary people, who can absolutely code as good as any man, and we can lead, we can do other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that that really was, perhaps not the beginning, but that was that snowball starting to get some more traction, and build bigger as we came down that hill. Because we had champions behind that, like Josepha, because Matt was behind that kind of movement as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, and because my voice started to grow within our community, people would start to approach me and Ali Nimmons and say, we really do want to have like more diversity at this WordCamp, or at this event. Do you know a black person who would be willing to speak? Do you know a woman who would be willing to speak there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we thought, well, how do we respond to this, right? How do we tell people, well, check with this person, check with that person. And so we started to build a spreadsheet for ourselves, of people that we could recommend. And about 20 people into that spreadsheet, and literally two days after we started it, were like this doesn&#8217;t feel right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, we don&#8217;t know everybody, right? Believe it or not, I don&#8217;t know every black person in WordPress. I just don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know every disabled person. I don&#8217;t know every woman in WordPress. And so for me to only recommend 20 or 30 people, means that the other people aren&#8217;t necessarily getting recommended by me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I understand networking, you know who you know. But we started to talk about the fact that we could build something that people could opt into, and others could search without us have to either gatekeep or be the go-between. And so we built Underrepresented in Tech for that reason. There&#8217;s a whole database there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find somebody for your podcast, you&#8217;re looking to hire somebody, you can go there. You don&#8217;t necessarily know why they&#8217;re underrepresented, so you might look at something, you might search WordPress and see what looks like a white male. Which you don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s sitting in a wheelchair, because you only see his face, or you don&#8217;t see anything. You don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it&#8217;s not our job to out people with what their disability or their gender is, or their sexual preference and orientation, or their abilities, things like that. So that&#8217;s not up to us. We do vet everybody that&#8217;s in the database. You have to trust that that person is who they say they are, and that we&#8217;ve vetted that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we wanted to give an opportunity for people to be found. That grew into what we started as a vlog. Because we were like, well, let&#8217;s be cutting edge. Let&#8217;s go back, let&#8217;s be retro, let&#8217;s have a vlog. Which quickly like, all right, we scrapped that idea, and turned it into a podcast. We have over a hundred episodes, over 10,000 downloads of our podcast, which is Underrepresented in Tech, where we talk about those issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about what it&#8217;s like to be an underrepresented person in technology. We sometimes bring in guests, so we get their perspectives as well. But the whole idea is that me as a 50 something year old woman, 55 now, but at the time wasn&#8217;t right. 50 something year old woman who has a disability, in tech, and a young black queer woman in tech, we kind of ticked a lot of those boxes, right, of what it means to be underrepresented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have perspectives, and we have ways that we can engage with people. But also people started listening, and people started learning. And the things that we write, and the things that we say, sometimes come under incredible scrutiny. But more often than not help inform, and also effect change within organisations, and within the community, to be more inclusive, and to at least understand and be aware of the fact that not everybody experiences the world and the WordPress community in the way that the person listening to it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I wonder if geography has anything to play here. So there&#8217;s a whole raft of things that I want to ask you on back of what you&#8217;ve just said, but let&#8217;s begin there. So, for example, if I live in your part of the world, so you are in North America. The complexion of countries in North America may very well be different to, I don&#8217;t know, for example, South America, or the Middle East, or Australia, you know, pick any part of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything in that, or do the proclivities of North America, do they spread across the board? So let&#8217;s just take two events. Let&#8217;s take Word Camp US and Word Camp Asia. If we were to try to apply criteria, would they be the same criteria in your estimation? Or, does geography in any way play a role in how you would want that event to look, based upon where it is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:55] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It&#8217;s definitely going to play a role, because underrepresentation is going to look different ethnically, within different places. It&#8217;s not going to change how many women are included. It&#8217;s not going to change the LGBTQ+ acceptance, in a particular community. It&#8217;s not going to change ability and disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I go to an event and nobody at all, there&#8217;s very few women on stage. Everybody looks the same. Everybody has the same physical abilities. Then I&#8217;m not seeing a lot of diversity there. That&#8217;s not to say that people aren&#8217;t, right? Sometimes you don&#8217;t see diversity. You can&#8217;t know that somebody is disabled necessarily, because they can walk. I don&#8217;t, but other people do, and still are disabled folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yes, you&#8217;re not always going to be able to tell just by looking at the lineup, or looking at the room. And certainly, ethnic inclusion around the world is going to look different. After we started Underrepresented in Tech, Nigel Rogers invited me to speak to his meetup, which was, and I&#8217;m never going to remember, I never remember where he is. But he is in one of the African nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I get online, I&#8217;m talking to this group of, it was all men I believe, all black men. And one of them said, we&#8217;re not minorities. And I said, I understand that in your community, you are not minorities. I would be the minority in your community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, globally, if you look at the entire WordPress community globally, yes. If you look at all the people who have contributed to core. If you look at all the people who have been part of release squads. If you look at the stages of all of the WordCamps around the world, you are still the minority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your faces do not have equal representation, in the entire community, and all of the different places. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re striving for, is that when we look at a global level, who is holding power? Who are the people who are being uplifted? And, can we make sure that other people have those opportunities too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a difficult tightrope to tread that one, isn&#8217;t it? Because obviously if you were to, for example, put on an event in, as you just described, say Africa, or in the center of Europe, the makeup of those communities would be different. And so casting the net wider and saying, well, this is about the world, that&#8217;s kind of interesting, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we&#8217;re really in the first generation of people that have been able to sort of do that really. Because we&#8217;ve got, you know, we&#8217;ve got instant communication, and things like that. And so we can have this much bigger perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s really interesting. If somebody&#8217;s putting an event on, and again, we&#8217;ll just take those as an example, let&#8217;s say Africa, or Europe, or wherever you know, something different from North America. Is there a correct amount of different things that you need to do, to satisfy these DEIB, well, I think criteria is the wrong word, but recommendations is maybe a better word, I&#8217;m not sure?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, do we have to see in the speaker lineup, okay, there needs to be 4 of this thing, and 8 of this thing, and 12 of this thing and, you get what saying? Does need to be so prescriptive, or is it more of, okay, we&#8217;ll try our best? We&#8217;ll do what we can, and we&#8217;ll accept what comes out the other end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:54] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> There&#8217;s a little bit of a combination, that&#8217;s kind of a spectrum. And somewhere in the middle of those two things that you just said is what I would love to expect. And part of that is, take a look at the, what you&#8217;re doing to recruit. If all you do is put it out, and just say anybody, this is what I&#8217;ve been told. It&#8217;s out there, anybody can apply. I can&#8217;t help it if minorities aren&#8217;t applying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, yes and no, because you can invite people to apply. If traditionally your event has had white faces, and mostly male on stage, do people who are not white faces and mostly male, feel encouraged to apply? Do they feel that&#8217;s a space that they&#8217;re welcomed in? Do they feel that that&#8217;s a space where they have a voice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What have you done to make sure that those people feel that they could be included, and not excluded, because of what you historically have had on stage, or historically have had as your outreach, or historically have had as your organising team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you really do want to make a difference going forward, what can we do? We can invite people to speak. Just because we have always had it as the luck of the draw, doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be that way. We can say, I want to make sure that I am inviting people to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that I&#8217;ve suggested in the past is, don&#8217;t just say, Sarah Smith over here, you have a darker face than Michelle does, we want you to speak. And then hope that she&#8217;s going to suggest a topic, or apply with a topic that fits. So what I&#8217;ve always said is, we really do want you to speak, I want to make sure you&#8217;re in our lineup, can you suggest three topics? And then we can make sure that one of those topics fits within everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, if everybody wants to talk about SEO, unless it&#8217;s an SEO conference, that&#8217;s not a good lineup, right? So you need to make sure that the topics work too. But if Sarah Smith says, I could talk about SEO, I can talk about building your public persona, and I can talk about outreach to underrepresented communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve given Sarah three different things, and one of those topics is most likely to be able to be in your speaker sessions, in your topics, without overlapping other people&#8217;s topics. So there are definite ways that you can increase your diversity on your stage, by making sure that you&#8217;re inviting people to speak, at the very least encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there is a process of, there&#8217;s work to be done basically. If you are, let&#8217;s say you are putting on an event as described, in the scenario that you are suggesting, merely saying there&#8217;s the form, it&#8217;s online, everybody can access that form. That&#8217;s possibly not going to be enough because of history, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been to a WordPress event as me, then all of the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle kind of fit. I should probably say, if you haven&#8217;t seen my face before, I am a white male. And so, you know, if I attend any of these events, there&#8217;s really no impediment to anything for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is what you are saying that, if it&#8217;s not a situation where you see people on the stage that look like you, think like you, behave like you, it&#8217;s unlikely that you are going to make the effort to go in the first place. And so you need to take steps to redress that balance. And those steps have to be proactive, because it&#8217;s not going to happen by accident, given what we&#8217;ve got in the past, the history of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:55] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> And think about the history of a disabled person. Think about the history of a minority person. Think about the history of women. Not only have we not seen ourselves there, but in many cases, we&#8217;ve been discouraged and actively barred from access to those kinds of events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if as a disabled person, I&#8217;ve tried to go someplace, there&#8217;s no curb cuts, there&#8217;s stairs, there&#8217;s escalators. I have to go in through the kitchen to have access to an event. I would be discouraged from attending that event. Would I love to be on stage, yeah. But if I can&#8217;t actually get on the stage, what good is it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just from the perspective of a disabled person. If I walked into a dark room of a meetup, and I&#8217;m the only woman, with 10 men in a darkened room, how does that make me feel welcomed? That doesn&#8217;t. Because now I&#8217;ve put myself in a position where mothers all over the world say, never put yourself in a dark room with a bunch of men, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s just history that comes along with being in an underrepresented group, that says to us, and whether that&#8217;s passed on through oral tradition or, you know, our families have taught us, or it&#8217;s just our own experiences in the past. We can sense, by looking at something in the history of something, whether or not we would traditionally be included in that event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we have people like me, who just like try to break those barriers open. Because I have broad shoulders and thick skin. I want to make sure that other people behind me feel welcomed, and have the access to those things. So I&#8217;m willing to be the person to suffer the slings and arrows, as Shakespeare would say, to make sure that it&#8217;s easier for other people to go through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of myself as that icebreaker ship, that&#8217;s going through, you know, the Arctic, making it possible for other ships to follow through in my path. It&#8217;s not easy. And sometimes there are sleepless nights involved with some of those things, because you put yourself out there in a way that says, I need to see access for more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other people who have traditionally held those positions, aren&#8217;t necessarily willing to give them up. And I understand that because power is a powerful thing, and we like being in a position of power, traditionally. And so the idea of seeding some of that power to other people, whether that&#8217;s a space on a stage, whether that&#8217;s in a boardroom, you know, that you bring people on your board, whatever that looks like. It&#8217;s not easy to include people that don&#8217;t look like us, and might have other ideas than us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s truly how we make a better community, and better products. I use this example all the time when I talk about inclusion. Back in the forties and fifties, they marketed vacuum cleaners to men, by showing pictures of vacuum cleaners with women in their pearls, and there are high heels and beautiful smiles, vacuuming their houses. Do you know how we market vacuum cleaners today? It&#8217;s how they work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we see a picture, a dog is knocked over a plant, and the Roomba, or somebody else is vacuuming it up. Kids spill Cheerios, let&#8217;s cut to a picture of that vacuum cleaner picking up the Cheerios. We talk about what the product does, not how pretty the woman looks using it. Because guess how many women actually want a vacuum cleaner for Christmas? Zero. That should not be a gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the idea is, more women started to join boardrooms, and more women started to be marketing and ad people, in the seventies and eighties, and we started to see some of that change. Because traditionally, women are the one now buying those kinds of products for the home. Let&#8217;s appeal to her, instead of show a man how happy your wife will be if you bring home a vacuum cleaner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same thing is true in every place, is you bring more people who have different experiences into those decision making processes, and you make a better product or a better service, to appeal for more sales. So it&#8217;s just good business. For your bottom line, much less, let&#8217;s be inclusive and let&#8217;s do the right thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you prefer carrot or stick for this? And, is it necessary to sometimes deploy both. My intuition is that you are going to prefer carrot. But maybe the stick has to come out at various times. And I have seen those, I don&#8217;t really know what the right word is, but I&#8217;ve seen those miniature battles, if you know what I mean, where people have said one thing, and then there&#8217;s been people reacting and saying, we don&#8217;t need this, and they&#8217;re trying to explain it, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, carrots or stick? Would you rather that we were able to introduce this idea and everybody came on board? Or, do we have to at some point say, look, nope, this is just what&#8217;s going to happen, you&#8217;ve got to come along for the ride?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:05] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Obviously carrot would be the better thing. If we can show people why inclusion is better, and how they can make their products and services better by bringing in more perspectives, and bringing in more experiences that people have. Those lived experiences are really what enrich the whole product and the whole process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, whether it&#8217;s a service or it&#8217;s a product. How are people using it? If we only approach things from one perspective, we could only sell to that perspective, plus or minus maybe one standard deviation. But if we can make that bell curve wider instead of narrower, we have an opportunity to do more, and affect good for more people through what it is that we have created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to do that, we have to understand how more people are using our products and services, or what we intend our products and service to be, so that we can appeal to all of those people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have a sense that during the time that you&#8217;ve been in the community, things have changed? Can you, for example, give us an anecdote or a story about something that you know has changed, as a result of something maybe that you said, or somebody else said, which can just deliver the message that, well, everything is not set in stone. Things that were once the way they were can be altered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:09] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So WordCamp US, the first one after the pandemic had shut everything down, was in San Diego. It was a very small event. They only sold, I think, 650 tickets, including sponsors and speakers. So it was, you know, that&#8217;s still a big event, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but as a global event, a very, very small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was there with my scooter, and tried to navigate an entire event. And by the end of the second day, I was in tears, because it was so difficult to be there as a disabled person. I got stuck in the bathroom, in the lobby bathroom, not in my hotel room. But in the lobby bathroom, because of the way that the room was built, and the exit was built, and where the trash can was, I couldn&#8217;t get close enough to the door to be able to open it, pull it to the side, and then go through the door. I literally had to wait until somebody came through. I would&#8217;ve texted somebody, I would&#8217;ve called somebody if somebody hadn&#8217;t come through, you know, fairly soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But somebody else had to come through that door to let me out. And that&#8217;s not, we&#8217;d like to be as independent as possible. When you&#8217;re a disabled person, you don&#8217;t want to have to rely on people to do everything for you. That doesn&#8217;t ingratiate you to the community, when you&#8217;re constantly begging and asking for assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that wasn&#8217;t the only problem that I had there. Several of the doors to access buildings didn&#8217;t have paddles, so they wouldn&#8217;t open themselves. So I had to ask people to help me get in and out of doors. My room, which was tagged as a handicapped accessible room, had a tub that I would&#8217;ve had to step over and into, which is dangerous for me. So I wasn&#8217;t able to actually take a shower or a bath. I had to, you know, sink bathe for five days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was just so many things that just were inaccessible for me. And at the end of that, I did talk to people about it, and told them that it was coming. But I wrote an article for Post Status called Five Days Without a Shower. I very unemotionally explained what had happened, and how things were difficult for me. I pointed out what worked, and the people who were very helpful in it. But then I also gave a list of things that I think could be done, looking at future events, to make them more accessible to other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I have a voice in our community. I know that people, you know, I&#8217;ve thousands of followers on Twitter, and I speak a lot, and that people know who I am. And so I realised that what I say in the community might be listened to more than people who don&#8217;t have that kind of following. And I don&#8217;t take that lightly. And I do try to use that for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I wrote this article. I gave copies of it to, you know, to Angela Gin, and I sent it to Matt Mullenweg and just, this is the experience, this is what I think we could do better. As a result of that, Wordcamp Asia, which I attended this year, reached out to me and said, we want to make sure, but this is what we&#8217;ve put in place and I think that everything is accessible to you. And it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The places that had stairs, they had put temporary ramps, so that I could get to them. The stage I was speaking on, I didn&#8217;t have to try to walk up three stairs, they had a ramp there for me. So everything was accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US this year, we had a team specifically for accessibility. You know, Alex was on that team, and he was looking at the accessibility from, no pun intended, looking at the accessibilities from the perspective of blind man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he was looking over the website. He was making sure that there were things in place, that he couldn&#8217;t get lost in a space that big if he wasn&#8217;t, you know, always having somebody on his side. So we had phone numbers in place where, if he literally couldn&#8217;t find his way out, somebody could come to him, and help him navigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We made sure that every place was accessible with wheels. We made sure that people who were neurodivergent, who might need quiet spaces, had the ability to step out and find a space that was just listed as a quiet space. We made sure that there were rooms for nursing mothers, that they could sit and nurse their children, or pump if they needed to. And not have to do that in a bathroom, which is not sanitary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was one of my suggestions, is that we had a person or a committee to look at the venue, to see what needed to change, in order for it to be an accessible event. So that was just one thing. One article that I wrote that was taken seriously, and that there&#8217;s a page in the handbook now for WordCamps, to make sure that you&#8217;re looking at things like curb cuts, like elevators. That there&#8217;s no place that, in a WordCamp, is inaccessible to somebody who can&#8217;t walk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s lots of things that I&#8217;ve been able to, because I have a voice in this community, put out there, that have then been able to be accommodated. WordCamp Europe was terrified, that because it was old, such an old city, that I would have difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was in constant contact with Estela Rueda, who made sure that everything that there was, you know, she said, this is where you can go. Some places have stairs, but this is the way to get around that. If you get stuck, here&#8217;s my number. Like there was lots of things, there was constant communication, in order to be able to know that not just me, but anybody with, physical disabilities would be accommodated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, is it easy to put myself out there as the disabled person who needs accommodations all the time? It&#8217;s not, right? So nobody likes to say, hey, my legs don&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m not a perfect person, and I can&#8217;t do the things that everybody else does. But by me being able to do that, hopefully means that I&#8217;ve, not only opened doors electronically for other folks, but put ramps in place, and given access to people who might not have had access otherwise. And so, yeah, I think there&#8217;s things that I&#8217;ve been able to say and do that have had an impact, positively, in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The curious thing, especially in terms of events, which is what we&#8217;ve just been talking about, is it doesn&#8217;t lessen the experience for people that don&#8217;t require it. You know, if there&#8217;s a ramp there, it&#8217;s no more difficult for me to use that. And so I think that&#8217;s brilliant. That&#8217;s such a nice tale of something actually changing, not in a heartbeat, but in a fairly short space of time. And so, well, bravo, firstly for writing the article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess it does beg the question, do these things get thought about, unless there is somebody like you who has to go through, well, let&#8217;s call it the pain or something like that? You know, somebody&#8217;s got to go through it, in order to live that experience, so that they can report back on what needs to be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you sense that there&#8217;s still people having to go through pain in the future, or do you think that as a community we are getting better, you know, at a fair pace, so that it&#8217;ll be approaching perfect soon? Anything like perfect soon, have we still got a long way to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:11] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think it depends on the location. I think some cities, some countries, it&#8217;s not as easy for them to pivot and be as accessible, just because of the history of the city. You know, there are places I said, oh, I&#8217;d love to go there. And somebody said, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to. Disabled people in that city have a tremendous difficulty getting around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in Asia. So, in Thailand, the cars are smaller, so to accommodate, to put me in an Uber, and also my scooter, which does come apart, some of that had to be at my feet and on the seat next to me, because it didn&#8217;t all fit in their trunk, for example. And so there are places that it might not be possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, like, I was in Phoenix Arizona earlier this year, and I called for an Uber, and I knew exactly what the person looked like, I knew what their car looked like, and I knew what their license plate was because that&#8217;s on the app. And this person pulled up, saw me in my scooter and sped away, because they didn&#8217;t want to deal with my scooter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They canceled it, but they didn&#8217;t say, hey, I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t have room in my trunk. Like they didn&#8217;t even communicate with me. They literally just drove away, and that was a terrible experience. And that was here in the United States, where we&#8217;re supposedly really accommodating to people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, it&#8217;s not always easy. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ever going to not have to look at it, and make sure that things are accessible. And I think that there will always be places that are historically more accessible than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They actually, in Athens now you can, with a wheelchair, go up on the Acropolis. I didn&#8217;t because my daughter didn&#8217;t want to, even though I wanted to. But I was also told that once you get up the top of there, of course it&#8217;s just this ruins. And that&#8217;s not easy to navigate in wheels either. But they&#8217;ve done everything they can, even to make things like the Acropolis accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so is everything always going to be accessible? No. There are apartments with only stairs. I will never be able to visit friends who live upstairs, in apartments that have only stairs. But being able to access public spaces, and finding ways to accommodate with temporary ramps, and things like that, I think is super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that as long as I&#8217;m in the community, and I continue to talk about these things, that people will think about them for their events. And make sure that as many people possible can attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You always seem very jolly, and we would say in the UK, fairly chipper. You know, you&#8217;ve got the glass is half full, kind of approach. Or at least that&#8217;s the impression that I have. But does this, so we&#8217;re going to stray into something maybe personal, you may not wish to reveal this, it&#8217;s entirely up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do these issues make you angry? Do you get a little bit annoyed on behalf of other people? Is there a bit of you that thinks, this is just not on? You know, it cannot be that events haven&#8217;t thought this through. It cannot be that these people aren&#8217;t represented. I&#8217;m just wondering, what the emotions it stirs in you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:44] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I would say frustration more than anger. It&#8217;s frustrating to me. Anger would come into place, if people acknowledged it and chose not to act. That&#8217;s anger. Not even looking, or not even thinking about it is the frustration. I think, traditionally, if somebody thinks about it, then they will try to be as accommodating as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to think about it and then not act, which is to make a deliberate decision not to include others. That&#8217;s when anger would come into play. But traditionally, anytime I&#8217;ve challenged or I&#8217;ve said, hey, have you thought about, most people are like, oh my gosh, I never even thought about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, WordCamp Buffalo this year. I was the mentor, I was part of the organising team for that event. And it was in an old school building. And the only way for me to get there was to go in the back of the building, up a little delivery ramp. And, was I angry? No, because I could still get in there. It was an old building that that was the only way to accommodate me, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m going into a restaurant, I don&#8217;t want to come in through the kitchen. To me, that&#8217;s anger. They haven&#8217;t thought about it. They don&#8217;t want to include people in wheelchairs, if there&#8217;s no way to get in, when you&#8217;re trying to be open to the whole public. There&#8217;s ways that you can be accommodating. There&#8217;s just lack of understanding, lack of thinking, lack of thought to inclusion, that&#8217;s frustration. Deliberately denying access, that&#8217;s anger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you ever on the receiving end of other people&#8217;s frustration and anger? Do the causes that you champion, do sometimes you find that your social media is full of people who disagree with you, and perhaps, maybe disagree as too polite term there? Does it sometimes descend into things that you&#8217;d rather didn&#8217;t happen? In other words, is it always equanimous, the kind of conversations you have, or does it sometimes get a little bit fraught and frayed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:24] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It does. A year and a half ago, I think, I wrote an article for a Post Status, called Misogyny In WordPress Is Real. And talked about the fact that women are still denied access, and still undervalued in a lot of places. And, you know, specifically, I pointed to that thread of all those people talking about the all women non-binary release, when Joost had posted about it in Advanced WordPress and Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other things that I&#8217;ve pointed to specifically, some of it tech related, some of it&#8217;s specific to WordPress. And the amount of people that attacked me, men, I will say. The number of men who posted replies to that post or comments on that post, completely misogynistic. It&#8217;s like, oh, look you&#8217;ve proven my point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And attacked me openly on, you know, Twitter and things like that. I mean, it irritating, right? But it doesn&#8217;t anger me, because I&#8217;m like, okay, so you are just set in your misogynistic ways. Block. I will just block you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People talk about me all the time. They don&#8217;t necessarily say kind things. I can&#8217;t own what somebody else thinks of me, that&#8217;s on them. So, you know, block them and move on. That&#8217;s the best way to be. I could be all angsty and carry it with me in a negative way, but I know that the work that I&#8217;m doing in our community, to try to level the playing field, to try to forward inclusion, the DEIB work, means that I&#8217;m going to encounter people that don&#8217;t agree with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, fine. Move on. I&#8217;m going to try to talk to the people who do, who want to learn. If I can educate in a way that helps people learn, and they at least consider, if not actually enact change, I&#8217;ve done some good. And if there are people who are absolutely going to stonewall, because they like the way that things are, I can&#8217;t move a stonewall. I&#8217;m going to move on to the people that I can help. And so those are the kinds of things that I look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, am I always cheery? No. That is what you&#8217;re going to see publicly, of course. But you know, I referenced the fact that, by day two of WordCamp, I was literally bursting into tears, because I was so frustrated by the fact that I couldn&#8217;t access things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it feel good when you get attacked? No, it doesn&#8217;t. You know, I challenged WordCamp Europe this past year, because the first couple of, it was three or four I think, announcements of the speaker lineup were less than 20% women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always hard to judge ethnicity, and you can never tell by looking at a person that they might not be an ethnic minority. You can&#8217;t tell if somebody&#8217;s part of the LGBTQ+ community. You don&#8217;t know if somebody&#8217;s non-binary. I acknowledged all of that, and I said I really hope that we see more of a balance going forward, with the rest of the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that one tweet has almost 30,000 impressions, because people either said, yes, absolutely, we need this, or you don&#8217;t understand how it is in Europe, Michelle. It&#8217;s not the same as it is in the US. I acknowledge that. But you have women in Europe, right? You do have minorities, you have people of color, you have people with different abilities. You have all of the different things that make up underrepresentation. So to only show us a bunch of white men, really starts to make you wonder, well, what is the rest of the lineup going to look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say I created controversy, I actually pointed out the controversy. I did not create controversy. The controversy already existed. I was simply the conduit, by which the rest of the world started to notice it. Because we&#8217;re so used to seeing so many white men in every lineup, but we need to make sure that that changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I had people, I mean, I went to WordCamp Europe. I had people there telling me things like, you don&#8217;t understand. I had people sign up on my calendar, just to tell me how wrong I was, and to say that you have a big voice in this community, you need to use it better. And I said, well, I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not always going to be everybody&#8217;s favorite person. I actually have a sticker, I will bring one to you next time I see you, Nathan, that says, I&#8217;m not everybody&#8217;s cup of tea, and I&#8217;m okay with that. Because if you&#8217;re going to be a change agent, if you&#8217;re going to try to help things be better, there will be people who don&#8217;t like what you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who feel challenged by what you&#8217;re doing. And there will be people who just flat out disagree with you. And that&#8217;s okay. Those are not the people that I&#8217;m going to change. The people that you can actually influence, are the people who want to do better, and don&#8217;t realise that they haven&#8217;t been to that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, if you listen to my words and you think, gosh, I could be more accommodating, I could outreach to people who don&#8217;t look like me, and really make the speaker lineup more diverse. If those people have listened to me and enact a change, and really think about the way they do things, then I can say my work is done. Or at least you know, part of my work is done, and I will continue to fight the good fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s the perfect segue then to probably round it off. And if I ask you, Michelle, where can people contact you? Should they have those intuitions, and they do wish to speak to you. Where&#8217;s the best place? What&#8217;s the selection of things that you, are you most frequently using?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:01] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Yeah. So I am still on, I like to call Twitter, but X. You can&#8217;t change your name on there, once you have so many links back to you. Yes, you physically can change your name, but I&#8217;m still @michelleames on Twitter and X. But if you go to meetmichelle.online, you will find access to all of the different things that I&#8217;ve done, my projects, WP Speakers, Underrepresented in Tech, WP Career Pages. All of those things that I&#8217;ve done for the community, to try to help people find jobs, help people find speakers, and just make the world a little bit more balanced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will make sure that every single one of those is listed in the show notes. So if you head to WP Tavern, at the very least, you&#8217;ll know that they are there. Michelle Frechette, thank you so much for chatting to me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:44] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It was my pleasure. Thank you for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://meetmichelle.online/\">Michelle Frechette</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to sound like a lot, and that’s because it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette is the Director of Community Engagement for StellarWP at Liquid Web. She was called &#8220;The busiest woman in WordPress,&#8221; by Matt Mullenweg at WCUS 2022. She is also the host of the WP Coffee Talk podcast, co-founder of Underrepresented in Tech, creator of WP Speakers and WP Career Pages, president of the board for Big Orange Heart, Director of Community Relations and contributor at Post Status, co-host of the WP Motivate and Audacity Marketing podcasts, host of the WP Constellations podcast, author, and a frequent organiser and speaker at WordPress events. Michelle lives outside of Rochester, NY where she’s an avid nature photographer. You can learn more about Michelle at meetmichelle.online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, like I said, that’s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This willingness to engage in all manner of WordPress projects has given Michelle a voice, and she’s on the podcast today to discuss a topic which is close to her heart, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She talks about her experiences at WordPress events, and how they were not always easy for her to attend and be a part of. Michelle uses a scooter to get around and there have been situations in which she could not enter venues and access all the facilities. This frustration made her take action and, as you’ll hear, effect change at subsequent events she attended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not all about events though. Michelle talks about the wider goals of making all aspects of the WordPress community more opening and inclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being one of the voices promoting this message has not always been easy, and we hear about how Michelle copes with those who disagree with her quest to create change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in thinking about inclusivity, and how embracing diverse perspectives can impact the WordPress community, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stellarwp.com/\">StellarWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/\">Liquid Web</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpcareerpages.com/\">WP Career Pages</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpspeakers.com/\">WP Speakers</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.underrepresentedintech.com/\">Underrepresented in Tech</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/5-days-without-a-shower/\">Five Days Without a Shower</a> article</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/misogyny-in-wordpress-is-real/\">Misogyny in WordPress is Real</a> article</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/michelleames\">Michelle on Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://meetmichelle.online/\">Michelle&#8217;s website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Jan 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"Do The Woo Community: Content Strategies for Woo and WordPress Businesses with Adam and Emma\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=78922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://dothewoo.io/content-strategies-for-woo-and-wordpress-businesses/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:438:\"<p>Adam and Emma talking about all things content when it comes to building brand recognition and trust for your Woo and WordPress business.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

I would like to talk about what my life was like before I met WordPress, how I met WordPress, and the freedom it has brought me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-before-i-met-wordpress\">Before I met WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If I remember correctly, the first time I touched a computer was when I was in junior high school. I remember a big all-in-one desktop machine coming to my house with Windows 3.1 OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japan at the time, magazines dealing with computers and programming were being published for users. It&#8217;s unthinkable now, but the magazine had pages and pages of &#8220;printed&#8221; code to run small tools and games! I remember typing that code line by line into the computer and being so excited to see the incredibly simple racing game working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the same time I was in middle school, I met the guitar. From then on, I fell in love with music and spent most of my time from middle school to my 20s playing the guitar, forming bands with friends, and performing at live shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-meet-with-programming\">Meet with Programming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, of course, it is not easy to earn money in the music world and make it my lifelong career. When I was around 30 years old, I started thinking about my future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until then, I had experienced various jobs in order to earn income for my music activities. Many of these jobs were Internet and computer-related, such as helping end-users improve their Internet experience and configure hardware over the phone. At the same time, I was also using music software to compose music. I decided to take advantage of these experiences and become an engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, at that time I was already over 30 years old. Generally speaking, it&#8217;s probably a late age to start programming or gain experience as an engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to fill that gap, I studied hard and obtained several qualifications necessary to become an engineer. Fortunately, I was able to get a job as a programmer even though I had no experience as an engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that company, I was able to work on languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#. However, in a desperate attempt to make up for the lack of experience, I probably pushed myself too hard. After two years of work, I lost my mental and physical balance and quit my job.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-meet-with-wordpress\">Meet with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we need money to survive. I started working as a freelancer, and at first I gradually increased my abilities and experience through small projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those projects involved customizing already published WordPress sites. The first time I met WordPress was around 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I developed WordPress sites from the beginning by myself and got involved in larger projects, so projects related to WordPress started to take up most of my work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While searching for information about WordPress on the internet, I learned about the existence of the community. In 2020, I also attended <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/tokyo-wordpress-meetup/events/271290548/\">an online Meetup event</a> for the first time. At that time, I didn&#8217;t fully understand what &#8220;open source&#8221; or &#8220;contribution&#8221; meant. However, as I met people who were willing to generously share their technology and experience and who were contributing to making open source better, I became more fascinated with WordPress and wanted to get involved in the community in some way and contribute in any way I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-contribution-with-code\">My First Contribution with Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was just developing a WordPress theme. I was looking through the browser&#8217;s developer tools to see what CSS was applied to the block on the block editor. By chance, I discovered a small CSS typo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I knew very little about Git and had never used a CLI tool. However, it turns out that this code is contained in a project called Gutenberg, which is managed on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first ever pull request to the Gutenberg project, and my first contribution with code to the WordPress community. Just one line change!</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/6GI1ZS0N-0MRgSYh9IupC93IGHvMnMCvDmDReeb17bs-FZJbTm9NRN8CLnKG6VhMkRktfzvk4zYSJnaFpKjthkxml1PQsoO8SuwL8gMMOUyqCZ70hQhBLAIcW4tV1kHLsrCkntyr3ZWWwPrcRAPqmA\" alt=\"Screenshot of Github\" />My first pull request to the Gutenberg GitHub repository\n\n\n\n<p>I was so excited to imagine that the code I had written, even though it was just a small change, would become part of WordPress itself and be spread around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-deep-dive-into-gutenberg\">Deep Dive into Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I started checking out Gutenberg issues and sending small pull request whenever I had time. Through that experience, I learned that WordPress was created by a huge number of people and is evolving at an alarming speed every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2022, I became part of the Gutenberg team. In June 2023, I was honored to be invited to join the Gutenberg Core team. I became more immersed in contributing to Gutenberg, discussing things with other members through Slack and GitHub Issues, and working on solving more complex problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-economic-freedom\">Economic Freedom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many members of the WordPress community contribute as volunteers. I&#8217;m one of them, and I was struggling to find time to contribute to the WordPress community while also working to make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2023, <a href=\"https://loos.co.jp/\">LOOS Co., Ltd.</a>, a company represented by a member of the Japanese WordPress community that sells WordPress themes and plugins, will support my contribution activities to WordPress. Thanks to his support, I have been able to spend more time contributing to WordPress and earn a good income at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My contributions to the Gutenberg project also made my GitHub account very active. I believe that this, more than any other resume, objectively proves what I can do. I believe that there are clients who have come to commission work from me after seeing my history of activities like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-wordcamp\">My First WordCamp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2023, I attended <a href=\"https://tokyo.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Tokyo 2023</a> held in Japan. This was the first offline WordCamp I ever attended, and the first time I was a WordCamp speaker. I was able to meet many friends that I had only interacted with through the internet and video calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wctokyo/53304247147/in/album-72177720312401523/\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53304247147_2138125dc4_z.jpg\" alt=\"WordCamp Tokyo 2023\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a>\n</div>Photo by Chiharu Nagatomi / <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.ja\">CC BY 4.0</a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-open-and-positive\">Be Open and Positive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s an issue or a pull request, the WordPress community raises, discusses, and makes decisions every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three things that I think are very important in this process:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Everything is done in the open</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thinking rationally based on objective facts and listening to each other&#8217;s opinions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Always be positive and strive to create something better</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every discussion and decision made in the WordPress community should be based on these three ideals. With the development of social media, we now have many opportunities to come into contact with negative emotions, and this psychological safety is soothing to my spirit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-your-action-may-save-the-world\">Your action may save the world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither WordPress Core nor Gutenberg is perfect. There are tons of problems to solve, just like there are tons of tickets and issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have to write code. If you have the courage to take a step forward and share what you think is a problem or challenge in an open space, those who see it may be able to solve it and help other WordPress users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-6450_6d576e-d3\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\"

OS を搭載した大きな一体型のデスクトップマシンが自宅にやってきたことを覚えています。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>当時の日本では、ユーザー向けにコンピュータやプログラミングを扱う雑誌が刊行されていました。今では考えられないことですが、その雑誌には小さなツールやゲームを動かすためのコードが何ページにも渡って「印刷」されていました ! 私はわけも分からず、BASIC 言語で書かれたそのコードを一行一行コンピュータに打ち込み、おそろしくシンプルなレースゲームが動いた事にとても興奮していた事を覚えています。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ちょうど同じ中学生の頃、私はギターに出会いました。それからというもの、私は音楽にのめりこみ、中学生から20代までのほとんどの時間を、ギターを演奏したり、友人たちとバンドを結成したり、ライブに出演する事に費やしてきました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-プログラミングとの出会い\">プログラミングとの出会い</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>しかし、もちろん音楽の世界で収入を得て、それを一生の仕事とする事は簡単なことではありません。30才頃のとき、私は将来の事を考えるようになりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>私は、音楽活動のための収入を得るために、それまでに色んな仕事を経験してきました。それらの多くはインターネットやコンピュータに関連するものであり、例えば電話を通じて、エンドユーザーのインターネット環境の改善、ハードウェアの設定を手助けする仕事でした。また同時に、作曲のために音楽ソフトウェアも使用していました。私はこれらの経験を活かし、エンジニアとなる事を決意しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>しかし、私はその時にもう30才を超えていました。一般的に言えば、プログラミングを始めたりエンジニアとして経験を積み始めるには遅い年齢でしょう。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>私はその溝を埋めるために必死で勉強し、エンジニアとして必要ないくつかの資格を取得しました。そして幸いにも、エンジニアとしての経験が無いにも関わらず、プログラマとしての職を得る事が出来ました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>私はその会社で、HTML、CSS、PHP、C# といった言語に関わる事が出来ました。しかし、足りない経験を必死で埋めようと、私は無理をしてしまったのでしょう。2年間の仕事を通じて、私は心身のバランスを崩し、退職しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-との出会い\">WordPress との出会い</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>もちろん、生きていくためにはお金が必要です。私はフリーランスとして活動をはじめ、最初は小さなプロジェクトを通じて、自分が出来る事や経験を少しずつ高めていきました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>それらのプロジェクトの中には、既に公開されている WordPress サイトをカスタマイズするものも含まれていました。はじめて WordPress に触れたのは 2018年の頃です。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>それから、自分1人で最初から WordPressサイトを開発したり、より大きなプロジェクトに関わる事で、自分の仕事の多くを WordPress に関するプロジェクトが占めるようになっていきました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress に関する情報をインターネット上で調べているうちに、コミュニティの存在を知りました。2020年に、初めて<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/tokyo-wordpress-meetup/events/271290548/\">オンラインの Meeup イベント</a>にも参加しました。私はその頃、「オープンソース」や「貢献」とは何なのかという事も十分に理解していませんでした。しかし、自身の技術や経験を惜しみなく共有したいと考える人たちが集まり、そのオープンソースをより良くしていこうと貢献している人たちに出会った事で、より WordPress の魅力に惹かれ、自分も何らかの形でコミュニティに関わり、自分が出来る方法で貢献したいと考えるようになりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-はじめてのコードでの貢献\">はじめてのコードでの貢献</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ちょうど WordPress テーマを開発していた時です。私は、ブラウザーの開発者ツールを介して、ブロックエディター上のブロックにどのような CSS が適用されているかを調べていました。偶然にも、小さな CSS のタイポを発見しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>私はその頃、Git についてもほとんど理解していませんでしたし、CLI ツールも使った事がありませんでした。しかし、このコードは Gutenberg と呼ばれるプロジェクトに含まれており、そのプロジェクトは GitHub で管理されている事が分かりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>これは、私が人生で初めて、かつ Gutenberg プロジェクトに初めて送ったプルリクエストであり、初めての WordPress コミュニティへのコードによる貢献です。たった一行の変更だけです !</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/6GI1ZS0N-0MRgSYh9IupC93IGHvMnMCvDmDReeb17bs-FZJbTm9NRN8CLnKG6VhMkRktfzvk4zYSJnaFpKjthkxml1PQsoO8SuwL8gMMOUyqCZ70hQhBLAIcW4tV1kHLsrCkntyr3ZWWwPrcRAPqmA\" alt=\"\" />Gutenberg GitHub リポジトリに初めて送ったプルリクエスト\n\n\n\n<p>ほんの僅かな修正ですが、私が自分で書いたコードが WordPress そのものの一部となり、それが全世界に広がる事を想像し、私はとても興奮しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gutenberg-に深く潜り込む\">Gutenberg に深く潜り込む</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>それから、私は時間がある時に Gutenberg の issue を調べたり、小さなプルリクエストを送る事を繰り返すようになりました。その経験を通じて、WordPress は膨大の人の手で作り上げられており、毎日恐ろしいスピードで進化している事を知りました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2022年2月に、私は Gutenberg チームの一員となりました。2023年6月には、光栄な事に Gutenberg Core チームにも招待されました。Slack や GitHub Issue を通じた他のメンバーとの議論、より複雑な問題の解決に取り組みながら、私はより Gutenberg へ貢献する事に没頭するようになりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-経済的な自由\">経済的な自由</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress コミュニティの多くのメンバーは、ボランティアとしての貢献しています。私もその1人であり、お金を得るための仕事をこなしながら、WordPress コミュニティへ貢献するための時間を確保する事にとても苦労していました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2023年7月、日本の WordPress コミュニティの仲間が代表を務める会社であり、WordPress テーマ・プラグインを販売している<a href=\"https://loos.co.jp/\">株式会社 LOOS</a> 様が、WordPress への貢献活動をサポートしてくれる事になりました。彼の支援のおかげで、私はより多くの時間を WordPress への貢献活動に充てる事ができるようになり、同時に十分な収入を得る事が出来るようになりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>また Gutenberg プロジェクトへの貢献を通じて、私のGitHub アカウントの活動履歴は非常に活発なものとなりました。これはどんなレジュメよりも、私がどのような事が出来るかを客観的に証明するものだと考えます。このような活動履歴を目にしてに、自分に仕事を依頼してくれるようになったクライアントも存在すると信じています。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-はじめての-wordcamp\">はじめての WordCamp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2023年10月、日本で開催された <a href=\"https://tokyo.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Tokyo 2023</a> に参加しました。これは、私が初めて参加したオフラインの WordCamp であり、初めて WordCamp にスピーカーとして登壇したイベントでもあります。これまで、インターネットやビデオ通話を通じてしか交流した事のない沢山の仲間たちと会う事ができました。</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a

id=\"h-オープンであり-前向きである\">オープンであり、前向きである</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>issue や プルリクエストに関わらず、WordPress コミュニティでは日々沢山の問題提起がなされ、議論され、決定がなされます。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>このプロセスの中で、私が非常に重要だと思う事は以下の三点です。</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>すべてがオープンな場で行われること</li>\n\n\n\n<li>客観的な事実をもとに合理的に考え、お互いの意見に耳を傾けること</li>\n\n\n\n<li>より良いものを作り上げようと、常に前向きであること</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress コミュニティで行われている議論や決定は、ほぼすべてこの三つの理念に基づいているはずです。ソーシャルメディアの発達にともない、沢山のネガティブな感情に触れる機会が多くなってしまった現在、この心理的安全性は私の精神を癒してくれます。</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-あなたのアクションが世界を救うかもしれない\">あなたのアクションが世界を救うかもしれない</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress コアも Gutenberg も完全ではありません。膨大なチケットや issue があるように、解決すべき問題は山積みです。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>必ずしもコードを書かなければならないというわけではありません。勇気を出して一歩踏み出し、自分が問題や課題だと思っている事をオープンな場で共有すれば、それを目にした人達がその問題を解決し、世界の WordPress ユーザーの役に立つかもしれません。</p>\n<p>The post <a

This maintenance release fixes four bugs. One of them was pretty annoying for users first activating BuddyPress with version 12.1.1. In this particular case, the 12.0 deprecated code wasn&#8217;t loaded which could cause nasty errors with 3rd party BP plugins / themes not ready yet for the modern BuddyPress (12.0.0 &amp; up). That&#8217;s the reason why we&#8217;ve been working hard and as fast as possible to quickly wipe this bug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For details on all changes, please read the <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/releases/version-12-2-0/\">12.2.0 release notes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Update to BuddyPress 12.2.0 today in your WordPress Dashboard, or by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\">downloading it from the WordPress.org plugin repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Many thanks to 12.2.0 contributors <span class=\"dashicons dashicons-heart\"></span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jnie\">jnie</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/roberthemsing\">roberthemsing</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vapvarun\">vapvarun</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/emaralive\">emaralive</a>, &amp; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath/\">imath</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:15:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mathieu Viet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"Do The Woo Community: More Takeaways from State of the Word with Miriam, Nik, Patricia and Mariano\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=78917\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://dothewoo.io/more-takeaways-from-state-of-the-word/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:366:\"<p>One more show with reflections and takeaways from State of the Word 2023.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/more-takeaways-from-state-of-the-word/\">More Takeaways from State of the Word with Miriam, Nik, Patricia and Mariano</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 09:48:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"Matt: Art No One Can See\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=110719\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://ma.tt/2024/01/art-no-one-can-see/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:492:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Proprietary software is like creating art which no-one can see.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, we&#8217;ve got a throwback episode about blogging. If you&#8217;re like me, you sometimes miss the early days of blogs, where the words were a little more pensive, and the images were a little less professional. If you&#8217;re on a slow hobby journey like so many of us are right now, give this one a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:58] (music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning. You may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their own project or business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool. We have long since outgrown that, but even 20 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because, even after those 20 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same, and that is to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help people have a place online where they can tell their stories, or share their projects, or set up their businesses. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So, I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, Oh, Jospeha, how old fashioned. I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website. And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first-ever website. So let&#8217;s dive in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So, have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, but also some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first, cause like, if you want the domain name WordPress.org, like, we own that, you can&#8217;t have that. But if you know that you want a domain like &#8216;WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com&#8217; like, that one might be more available. And if you know kind of the words you want in your domain, then you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mention all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it&#8217;s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start before you even know what WordPress is most of the time. So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is, what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date. There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service, where they will keep your WordPress software up to date and provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So it ranges all the way from full service like that, all the way down to essentially zero service, just kind of hands off. They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site, but they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you; they leave updating up to you, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself and the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software, and what you want, and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either services with the existing host that you chose or moving to a different host; however, that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually, most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click, and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, on the other side of that spectrum, that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server, or you know how to work in this thing called cPanel, etc. So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to WordPress.org/download and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment. Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little, I&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the LearnWP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host, as well as various other early steps of this process. If you felt like I blazed through all of that, which, honestly, I kind of did. You can work through those lessons in that course at your own pace, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this &#8216;Hello World&#8217; post. There&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare, like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMSs in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh. We&#8217;ve got now a website. We know kind of how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can be moderated, and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some choose-your-own-adventure guiding questions here. Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words? Mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want, three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to WordPress.org/themes and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to WordPress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically, so that you can see how things look right away. And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site, so if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely. And just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every WordPress instance ships with a theme, and it is fully functional when you get your site up and running, so you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready. And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites, is to add plugins to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality to it. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions? If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there. If that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find. And as a general side note here as well, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine. I&#8217;ll tell you this, I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms, and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So, yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the one hand, you definitely can. And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem and, obviously, hear some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Josepha</strong>: Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for for years, but also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009, and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy. We are the easiest of the hard options for CMSs like content management systems are just complicated. But we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game like you should have had a website for years, I mean, sure, that could be true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time to plant that tree is today. WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now, our small list of big things. Today we&#8217;ve got some look-back items and some look-forward items. So let&#8217;s hop right in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing is we have a year in review with the themes team. So much amazing work has been done by the themes team over the past year, both for reviewing themes and creating them. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to those in the show notes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a post out that just has some general celebrations from teams around the community. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that. It probably has been linked in quite a few places, but you know, we don&#8217;t always embrace those moments of celebration. We don&#8217;t always embrace our wins. And so it&#8217;s always good to share those early and often. There are probably more than just those two. So if you posted one or you saw a really interesting one that you think that we should know about, don&#8217;t forget to share it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Next, we have a leap into 2024 with Site Editor tools. So, on the new Developer Blog, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, there is a lot of excellent content there for whether you are like an advanced developer in WordPress or you&#8217;re kind of intermediate and ready to move into your advanced developer era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor will give you a powerful way to visually create every part of your site and tell your story. And this post will help you to kind of see how to handle everything from big style changes to simple copy updates, all in a single place. We want to make sure that you get the most out of your WordPress this year. And that post will give you a few standout tools and features that you&#8217;ll want to try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to keep an eye out for updates as we move into 2024 around team reps. So each team in the WordPress project goes through a process to review and elect team reps, and elections are happening now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Along with things that are happening now that you should keep an eye on, the annual goals, our big picture post has gone out as well. It went out at the end of the week last week. There&#8217;ll be a link to all of these in the show notes. And yeah, keep an eye out for, hopefully, a fantastic 2024 in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 17.5, early testing on WordPress 6.5 and block themes, and everything in between. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress open source project sponsored by Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future Program. I&#8217;m so thrilled we were finally able to make it happen. Carolina Nymark is on the show today. Carolina is a core contributor sponsored by Yoast and has been an evangelist, educator and blogger about block themes when we all knew that it was coming but had no clue what it will be and when we still called it full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of you might have visited her site, <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">fullsiteediting.com</a> where she teaches developers and site builders how to use the block themes. Carolina also joined us on the Gutenberg Live Q&amp;As multiple times to talk about that. And I&#8217;m so happy to have you finally also on the podcast. Welcome, Carolina, and how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Thank you. I am very well. Thank you. So we are recording this on a Friday in January, and I have been back at work maybe only two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I had December off, which was very, very nice. I used WordPress, but I did not code anything for almost five weeks, so it was a really nice break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah, I imagine that. I got about two and a half weeks off over the holidays, but I&#8217;m back. Also two weeks. So it&#8217;s all a new year and I hope you got into the new year well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Block Themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So there have been early discussions, you and I and with others that we&#8217;re working on it, early discussions about the block themes in 2020 if not 2019. I&#8217;m a little bit unsure and I really want to thank you for being such a great advocate and educator for block themes. I think it has changed WordPress quite a bit. We are not there yet entirely, but how do you feel about block themes now that you have to work with them over four years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Well, it doesn&#8217;t feel like four years. It feels like it&#8217;s been much shorter. I agree, it&#8217;s not there yet. While I love working with the site editor and creating visual layouts that I can tweak as a coder, I do love that, but I still wish that we would have come further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So what do you think is missing? Do you have examples of what you find missing from when you go from a classic theme building and want to recreate the magic also in block themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yeah. So one of the big parts is that when we use PHP to build our themes, we use a lot of conditions if else to display different things depending on what&#8217;s happening, what the user is doing, what they&#8217;re viewing. We can&#8217;t really do that with blocks. At least not with the current core blocks that we have. What is also missing is a way to manage and base custom fields. Of course, the Gutenberg developers are very aware about the need for custom fields management, and it has been of course ongoing discussions for several months and it will happen in some form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now it has had to step back a little bit because a lot of the Gutenberg developers need to focus on the new data views, which is part of the&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s going to be a part of the admin redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So yeah, custom fields that I have seen so early. So there was this whole hangout last week with early views on what&#8217;s in the roadmap of 6.5 and also even if it wasn&#8217;t on the roadmap to go to 6.5, but it&#8217;s actively worked on, and one of them was to have in the block toolbar a button that you can connect something in the content of the block with a custom field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how that all surfaces, but that is really interesting approach because you don&#8217;t have to go out and go into a different interface. You can all do it there. But apart from there, the conditions are pretty big. I think what it comes down to is that you build a lot of templates for different kind of cases, use cases, and that duplicates code quite a bit. So when you want to migrate a site from a classic theme to a block theme, there is no one click conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would you think a site editor should do? So I had the same conversation with Sarah two weeks ago and because I&#8217;m doing that for the Gutenberg Times, and I&#8217;m trying to find a good approach that other people could follow. So let me tell you what I do. I installed the health and troubleshooting plugin on my life site and then switched off all the other themes and switched on the themes that I wanted to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was testing the twenty twenty four I was testing Frost and some other of the block themes, one or two of them from Edna Snoren or Ellen Bauer and then see how my site changes with the new block theme. And then I made notes what needs to be changed. So this archive page needs to change and that needs to change, and here the block don&#8217;t. The biggest hurdle was that my featured image on the block loop, on the archive page is a landscape, and most of the themes that I tested, the feature image was portrait format. So that kind of thing, but that&#8217;s I think not a big&#8230; That&#8217;s an easy fix. You can change the template, you can change your aspect ratio and you&#8217;re done with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have my notes. I have my scope of the changes that I need to make, and then I&#8217;ll create a staging site, install the create block theme plugin, and then make my changes there. And then I can export that theme and import it into my live theme. Is that a good process or as good as any?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I do think it&#8217;s as good as any right now, but it really does sound way too complicated for the, how do I say it, the average user. And it&#8217;s difficult. How are we going to help them? How are we going to make it easier? But it also depends. It all depends on how complex your existing theme and your existing site is. But yes, start with pen and paper. Really write down the already must haves and do spring cleaning. If there are things that you don&#8217;t need, remove them. And then you won&#8217;t have the problem of trying to recreate at least those spots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I mean if you&#8217;re switching to a completely new theme, of course, there are going to be a lot of things that don&#8217;t match your current website. So they&#8217;re definitely going to be tweaking. And create a block theme is a great tool because yes, you can activate any block theme and export it as your own. So of course you&#8217;re not limited to using the default themes. If there is a block theme to define that matches what you want closer, pick any of them. What you want to look at though is the last updated date. You don&#8217;t want to pick a block theme that was updated in 2020 or 2022. You want one that is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good reminder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: &#8230; continued, developed, and supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good reminder. So it should be 2023 or something like that and not the default theme, but the update should be at least in 2023 if not in the last three months or so. That&#8217;s definitely a good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: So if you&#8217;re picking from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">wordpress.org</a>. Look at the reviews of this theme. Look at the support firm. Is the developer responsive or maybe they&#8217;re directing you to a different support firm where they&#8217;re active. That&#8217;s also absolutely fine. But just look to see that there is someone who&#8217;s able to help you if you run into bugs or if you&#8217;re blocked somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, most of the time when I switched themes before with classic theme to classic theme, there were always tweaks. There was no one switch and everything was good. There was always a little bit&#8230; CSS kind of change here and template missing here, and the condition are not working right. So I think that&#8217;s pretty much to expect when you switch themes and normally you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the third switch in five years for the site. So I think it&#8217;s pretty much on par with that. And I&#8217;m also late, but I also want to do some experimentation with the new features that are there, that are coming out, like the interactivity of PI and the block hooks and that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was really hard to do this without the block theme because they&#8217;re all built for block themes and the latest. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m switching over on the site. So that&#8217;s one thing, the site migration&#8230; But you come from the classic theme building. You&#8217;ve been a theme team rep for many, many years and have been&#8230; So if you are a theme builder and you want to create a block theme, what are the hurdles to overcome? Are there any blockers, pun intended, especially mental blockers? Are there something that is something people need to get on with it, so to speak?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yes. Mental blocker absolutely are big at perhaps the code challenges, unless you&#8217;re building something very, very highly custom and specialized. So as a coder, if you really enjoy coding, you might love PHP, and then suddenly, if you&#8217;re not working with a designer, of course because we have two different&#8230; Of course, more than two different ways to do this. But if you&#8217;re on your own and then suddenly switching from writing your templates in your code editor, and you have to go to this visual interface, you really need to learn how to maximize the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do need to learn how to sketch, draft the layout in the editor, and then you will go and make your tweaks. Once you have exported your base layouts for one template or 10 or maybe four is more realistic. When you have four templates, you have what font sizes, what colors, what spacing you&#8217;re using then you&#8217;re going to tweak the details in your exported theme.json file and you tweak the code in your templates. But you still have that element where you need to go to the visual interface and actually move things around, change the alignment, etc. And it&#8217;s a big change of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But it&#8217;s also lowering the barrier for those who don&#8217;t know how to code to create their own themes. So I think it&#8217;s a good balance to get more people involved in creativity and creating themes and do some designs. A lot of designers are actually not coders per se, and they might&#8230; I think what&#8217;s still missing, going back to the earlier question, is actually a user interface for editing the theme.json file. I know it&#8217;s all in the database and you can export it, but you still have to fiddle with that long and the theme.json files, the more features come in, the longer it&#8217;s going to become and the more unwilling it comes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Oh yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There are VS Code extensions that help with that, but I think you need to really squint quite a bit when you read the code to get into the right settings and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I absolutely three. So not all the settings in theme.json actually have an interface. It probably shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to all users, and that&#8217;s where do we draw the line? Do we really add an advanced view to the site editor or does it need to be in a plugin? And several people of course have tried to build this plugin because we do need it and have not succeeded or have needed to stop halfway because&#8230; Well, I can&#8217;t really tell why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: One reason is probably…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It&#8217;s just not easy. The base coding in Gutenberg, it just doesn&#8217;t make it easy to do that kind of option page, or at least not right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can also see that it&#8217;s really taxing to build a feature for something that&#8217;s so inactive development and has updates every two weeks to keep up with it, especially when you have a product. So I can see that the initial momentum getting this, &#8220;Oh, this is a great idea and let&#8217;s build it,&#8221; kind of weans away when after a year or two you still have to go in every month and update this thing because there&#8217;s new features or things have changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think great way to talk about block themes and thank you for that. Are you planning to work further on the <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">fullsiteediting.com</a> or do you think that the new block handbook has been overhauled enough to say, &#8220;Oh yeah, now documentation.&#8221; I think there was a reason why you graded that because there was no documentation and there was a lot of need for explaining the concept and all. But the new developer theme handbook has been overhauled in the last, I don&#8217;t know, four or five months. Do you think that the documentation is up to par now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yes. So Justin Tadlock who did most of their work on the handbook has been amazing. The handbook has been greatly updated and <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">fullsiteediting.com</a> has not, because I have not had the time. And it&#8217;s a bit of a stressor. I guess I do want to keep it up to date. I want to fight about what I&#8217;m exploring, what I&#8217;m finding, what problems I&#8217;m running into, and of course maybe some more code examples. It&#8217;s difficult for me to prioritize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: So there&#8217;s room for both. So <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">fullsiteediting.com</a> of course I can express opinions in a whole different way that you can&#8217;t do in a handbook, which needs to be very strict and act even a bit friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Neutral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m still a little bit apprehensive about how we&#8217;re going to keep it up to date. So even if we only have now three releases per year, that goes into WordPress Core, it&#8217;s still a lot to keep up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You need more volunteers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So if somebody wants to contribute to documentation specifically for the theme handbook, what would be the steps apart from having a Slack account and having a wp.org account, and a GitHub account?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: The easiest way is to, first of all, reach out in the theme review Slack channel from your account, and we can guide you a little bit more from there. So the team handbook is currently written in WordPress on the website. So the content is not managed right now on GitHub. It&#8217;s not marked on files. It&#8217;s actually WordPress. It&#8217;s a poster page custom post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, that lowers a lot of barriers actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: But all the issues when we see that the page needs to be updated, we add our issues to the documentation teams issue tracker on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, cool. So if you&#8217;re on the documentation team, you already know how the process works. That is really good. So dear listeners, if you have an aptitude for technical writing, your English is good enough, so Carolina is a non-native speaker, and I as a non-native speaker can read it. You are in it. You can join the team and you&#8217;ll have some great people there that help you. I know that Justin Tadlock has quite some onboarding and he&#8217;s happy to help anybody also with writing and do some copy editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don&#8217;t have to be scared just because you&#8217;re not a native English speaker to do that. All right. So this was all about block themes and I&#8217;m really glad that we talked about some of the issues there. So let&#8217;s get on with the show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Listener Questions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We sometimes also answer some questions that we get either from Twitter or listener question. And this question came through Twitter and that is how to use a classic menu in the navigation for block theme. And it&#8217;s very hard to find when you&#8230; And so I put it a little tutorial together, a quick tick I call it because it&#8217;s less than a hundred words or so on how to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s mainly the screenshot and where to find things, a little video. So you need to grab the header in the site editor and then the menu that is there from your theme. And then there is on the right hand side, there&#8217;s this toolbar or the sidebar where the block settings are normally and there&#8217;s one three-dot menu where the switcher where you can see all the classic menus listed that you had previously on your site and then you select it and it&#8217;ll magically appear in the navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think you don&#8217;t have to recreate all the classic menus that you had before when you switch it. That is definitely a hidden gem. I don&#8217;t know if you can surface it even better. We need to kind of talk to design about that, but that&#8217;s where you find it and it&#8217;s your secret superpower to know where it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, I think, if I understood this correctly and Carolina you help me out, when you only have one menu, the block theme magically adds it. If a navigation block is in the template, it will be added to the navigation block as a default. But if you have more than one classic menu, it doesn&#8217;t know which one to pick. So it kind of makes it up as it goes along. I think when you switch from twenty twenty to twenty twenty four, it takes the social menu, which is kind of weird, but that&#8217;s the randomness of this feature. But it also points you right there, this is something to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: At least that problem is quite obvious because it&#8217;s not the correct content inside the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, listeners, that was our quick tip of the week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Upcoming Events</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have some upcoming events that are on the list that happen in all kinds of different places. So first of all on February 7th at 12 noon UTC, the media component maintainers come together in a meeting to discuss phase three media items that could be ahead of development or phase three. And Anthony Burchell who is one of the maintainers, invites you to be part of it. And if you haven&#8217;t contributed to any code yet in the recent years, that is definitely a good place to see what work needs to be done and how it&#8217;s organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then February 8th, a day later, there will be a hallway hangout to discuss intrinsic design and how to use it in a real life projects with the block editor and the block themes and we will have some interesting people there. Fabian Kagy is going to be there, Tammie Lister, Justin Tadlock. They&#8217;re all proponents of the intrinsic design testing. Tadlock wrote a nice introduction to that on the developer blog a few months ago, but it&#8217;s definitely&#8230; But Fabian and Tammie, they have also some ideas of what&#8217;s still missing, what you can&#8217;t do with intrinsic design, which you still would need to do with your own CSS and some conditional coding and templates to get this going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they bring some solutions with them. Then not so far out January 25th at 15:30 or 3:30 UTC, there&#8217;s a developer livestream reviewing Gutenberg 17.5 by Ryan Welcher. He does it on Twitch. It&#8217;s not a scripted show, he just dives in into a topic or multiple topics and shows some code. If you haven&#8217;t followed Ryan on the Twitch stream, you can also follow him on YouTube. And he has this fabulous series of the block development cookbook. Every show is a little recipe on how to do things with a block editor development. And then also next week is the extensibility issued triage meeting on January 23rd at noon UTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a project board with increasing Gutenberg extensibility and we go over some of the columns there and see if we can move some of the issues or PRs forward to be slated for some of the major releases this year. So it&#8217;s going to be a real good&#8230; Yeah, there&#8217;s some agency developers in there. We also have joined by Gutenberg developers. So this is a chat meeting. It&#8217;s not a video meeting or something like that. Carolina, do you know of any events that listeners might, we could let them know about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: There&#8217;s rumors that there might be an upcoming hallway hangout about migrating from classic themes to block themes. But it&#8217;s not scheduled yet, but if you have the chance, definitely join one of these that we just spoke about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And speaking of events, there&#8217;s always in the theme review channel, there&#8217;s a theme meeting. When do they happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It&#8217;s every other Tuesday. I&#8217;m sorry, I believe it&#8217;s at 4:00 UTC. I&#8217;m usually unable to attend because of the timing, so I don&#8217;t have the exact time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. Well, we can look it up. Tuesday testing JavaScript. Theme biweekly 4:00 PM, Yes. 4:00 PM UTC. And the next one is, it&#8217;s on the 23rd. So next week, Tuesday is the fourth Tuesday. So it&#8217;s on the second and the fourth Tuesday, 4:00 PM UTC. And so if you want to be part of the theme development or theme review documentation team, you can join there and meet all the people there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: So during these meetings, we usually recap how many new themes went live this week, for example. We also repeatedly bring up things like, are the requirements still correct? We need to update them. What are we going to do about react-based themes, settings, pages, onboarding of users when we have a block theme of a need, an easier way for them to select the front page. So both about theme reviews, but also really wide topics. But they are, again, just posted that you can read of course, and also proposed topics too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you want to follow up on some of them, the summaries are posted on the make theme blog as well. Cool, cool, cool. Those are the events and meetings. There&#8217;s under <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/\">make.wordpress.org/meetings</a>, a calendar of all the teams meetings, not only the theme team but all the teams. So it gets a little bit overwhelming and you shouldn&#8217;t join every channel on WP Slack, but pick the team that you&#8217;re involved in or you want to be involved in. You can definitely be in a meeting every day of the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Oh yes. There are often meetings that collide as well if you&#8217;re interested in several topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And sometimes they&#8217;re Slack meetings, so you can actually switch between the meetings a bit because people need to type things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of extensibility, Fabian Kagy from 10up and also has been a guest on the show quite often, he started a conversation about extensibility for the new admin views, and Riad Benguella posted a great response on how extensibility is actually approached and what they&#8217;re planning once they have the APIs are finalized and they want to create APIs for retracing new fields, new layouts, new field types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the new layouts. The grid layout and the preview layouts and all that. Also, defining default views and fields and allowing third-party developers to have their own views for their pages. What they haven&#8217;t yet put in there, and they want to still do this before any extensibility is considered is inline editing and editing the fields and views in the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have not seen any design views for those interfaces yet, so that might still be a little bit off, but I&#8217;ll share the issue and the comment in the show notes, of course, like everything else that we talked about. But Riad is also summarizing the approach that the built the APIs, then UIs, and then if it all works together and the APIs are stable, then open that up to third-party developers to using plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he also has a suggestion on how third-party developers can start experimenting with it, and that is using the WordPress data views NPM package and start testing those. Documentation is available on the packages read me file, and you definitely can connect with Riad if you have any questions or something like that. But I think it&#8217;s time to start looking at that if you&#8217;re a plugin developer or a theme developer, just to make sure that you start getting the mindset and you see what the users are going to see. Any comments?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: So glad that this question was asked and highlighted, and I&#8217;m happy with the answer. And as always, when this is like, &#8220;We want it now,&#8221; we can&#8217;t have it yet. And third-party extenders, plugin developers, we really do need to help testing. Again, we need to be very clear in our feedback on what we need because we have to leave that feedback when there is still a chance to make changes. If something is not what we expect, the earlier the feedback, the better. Easier it is to respond to and address. I also do my part of the data views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to use it more to really get used to it. I have problems with the very, very narrow list. So on the left side you have a brief description, the name of your, for example, your template or your post. This part is very narrow, but I do like that you can switch views. So you can choose if you want the list, grid or a table. And there are so many more things that you can customize with filters already. So I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Also, like the grid layout patterns in the pattern data views or for&#8230; It would be really beautiful for the media library to have a grid layout like it is now. And even posts. If you want the feature image and you don&#8217;t need a list, but you want also kind of see how&#8230; Which have featured images and which don&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to the next topic that we have here that is early opportunities for testing. Thank you for bringing that up. Test, test, test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So Anne McCarthy has published a post called Early Opportunities to Test WordPress 6.5 ahead of beta 6.5 that is scheduled for February 13th. These are early opportunities to feedback and testing it for your own sake. It&#8217;s only a selection of features in the post, but it&#8217;s very good in the instructions of what you can do and what you should test. So a part of the burden for testing is you have to come up with what is it that I actually want to do? Have those decisions and make a list of it. And Anne McCarthy has done that particular work for you and shows you how to test the data views. Also, the pattern overrides and the font library, of course that has been in the works for quite a bit, and the robust revisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for templates and styles you now can have&#8230; In 6.4, we already have revisions, but now those are actually getting to the next step and being really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: The revisions are a really nice update. I also hope that we can do something to improve the post-op block editor revisions, which are not as easy to use, say, style visions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, absolutely. And in the post you also find ways on how to set up test websites for that. I also will share a link to the playground with the Gutenberg nightly that actually&#8230; At least for the data views, because you need to enable the experiments to do that for the data views as well as for the pattern overrides. So we have some playground instances&#8230; Not have some, but we build the blueprints for those so you can call them up in WordPress playground, which is a nice browser-based WordPress instance. It&#8217;s really amazing how that would work for someone who has done work with so many servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a long, long post, but it has all the details that you need for each feature. It&#8217;s divided up into explaining the feature, prerequisites and then test instructions and what you could do with it. Feedback, you could leave it on the post if you have some feedback or if something is not working, or you could do that as a bug report on the GitHub repository or just post it into the co-editor channel and we&#8217;ll figure out which part of your experience is actually the bug report or a feature request or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not always easy to get it right for a GitHub issue, but there are people here to help you. Definitely. Have you tested any of those features or looked at those apart from the revisions you said?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: No, I&#8217;ve tested them on my own. I haven&#8217;t read the full testing instructions. I mean, I have some feedback that I need to add, document and write down, and perhaps why not start working on fixing it as well. So I need to do that maybe next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Do you have something else that we could talk about it in community contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: We spoke a little bit about how to find the team&#8217;s team and how to help with the handbook or just join the meetings. But of course there are so many teams that you can contribute to, and the application for the contributor mentorship program has opened. So this is for the first quarter of 2024. It is open for both mentors and mentees. So if you&#8217;re an experienced, well actually, user. You don&#8217;t even have to be a developer. If you&#8217;re an experienced WordPress user, contributor, you can apply as a mentor. To be a mentee you do not have to have any previous experience, just be engaged and want to join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the mentorship program is a one-on-one mentorship or a group mentorship, which is new. So the group mentorship is new. You can actually apply to work on a specific project together with others with your mentor, which is really interesting. Nice idea. It&#8217;s great to meet more people and collaborate, which is a really nice opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you for bringing that up. Is there a deadline on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: The application deadline is February 7, and you can find the application by going to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">make.wordpress.org/community</a> and it&#8217;ll be one of the pinned articles on the top of that page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And of course we&#8217;re going to share the link to it in the show notes of this episode. That is a great new program for getting more contributors. It&#8217;s also meant to create contributor leadership as well, and also to have more sustained contribution. We have in many teams the problem that are these flyby contributors and sometimes you need continued contributions to make a team work and we need both. But I think it&#8217;s harder for contributors to have an ongoing relationship with a team, especially when they&#8217;re not sponsored and their work life or their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you have a family, your free time is all but WordPress. If you work as a freelance or in an agency, the workload can be up and down and sometimes you don&#8217;t have two months in a row where you can contribute. So this mentorship group is also meant for those who do feel they can do ongoing contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I think we come to the stage where we talk about what&#8217;s released and we have to talk about three releases. One is the release squad for WordPress 6.5 has been announced and release lead is again, Matt Mullenweg, release coordinators, Akshaya Rane, Hector Prieto, and Mary Baum. And core tech leads are David Baumwald and Pascal Bircher. And editor tech leads are David Smith and Riad Benguella. But there are in total 27 contributors on the list of release leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s also editor triage and design and all that. Carolina, you are also part of the release squad in 6.5. Thank you for raising your hand. And you are named as a default themes lead. That seems to be a new role on the release squad. What does that include for a release that doesn&#8217;t have a default theme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It means that you are continuing doing what a bundled theme component maintainer does. It is triaging track tickets, looking at new report issues. But the part that I wanted to focus on that we haven&#8217;t really done before is that we need to know what the new features are in the editor. Mostly that can affect our themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: When you say our themes, you mean previous default themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I mean, the default themes. Are there new features that should be implemented? Doesn&#8217;t have to be implemented, or shouldn&#8217;t. We have to make decisions about this and then we have to start looking at the code. Can we solve this? Do we need to fix CSS conflicts? We have to test on multiple, multiple workers expressions to see that we&#8217;re not causing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s pretty good. I really like that role, but it takes a lot of work because how many default teams are there? 15 or so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I&#8217;m hoping that we&#8217;re going to focus on the ones that are actually bonded when you install WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Not the ones that you download. At least not in this round. We haven&#8217;t brought this up, but there is a proposal to have a default theme task force. This was proposed in December and you can volunteer for it. We&#8217;re still waiting for more information, but the idea is that we do need more contributors to help triage all of the open issues. And triaging issues means that we read these issues and confirm is this actually a bundled theme issue or does it belong to a different component?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if the reported issue is a problem with a block, it probably needs to be moved to the Gutenberg repository and solved there because it affects more than the bundled themes. It affects all themes. So that&#8217;s one of the kind of sorting that this group would need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a brilliant idea, especially because it&#8217;s an early warning for changes in the block editor or in block themes that might trickle down to classic themes and changes CSS behavior. There&#8217;s one discussion right now about the specificity of elements and block themes and does that affect&#8230; If it&#8217;s changed, what&#8217;s the trade-off? It makes it the work that it would cause to update existing themes, but moving forward lessens the work. So I think with your role in there, you definitely can chime in early warning and also say, &#8220;Okay, well this is something we need to have in the developer notes because theme developers will have to take a look at that also for their theme.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this was missing. It&#8217;s the first release that I won&#8217;t be part of since 6.0 on my first release that I was part of on documentation, 6.0 to 6.4, all five releases. I was part of documentation or editor triage and it was really interesting to see how documentation actually surfaces there. That early warning part could have saved some of the hard work that was done retroactively when there was even a new note there or even a new minor version needed to be cut very early after the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to iterate on the release schedule, I think we talked about it earlier, but you can always look it up about beta one is scheduled for February 13th. 25 days left. So if you want to control it or you have some features that need to be moved forward, get on it. There are two more Gutenberg plugins, 17.6 and 17.7 with features that will go into 6.5. Afterwards it&#8217;s just bug fixing or maybe a little bit enhancement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then release candidate one and with field guide and dev notes deadline is March 5th, and that&#8217;s just before WordCamp Asia. So we all go release 6.5 and then head out to Taipei because WordCamp Asia starts on March 7th. The final release is on March 26th, 2024. It sounds also far away, but it&#8217;s really not a whole lot of time anymore to see what&#8217;s getting in there. So looking at the hallway hangout where contributors kind walk through all the features might be a good idea to just get up to par with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get 6.5, we get a minor release, 6.4.3. Aaron Jorbin is the release lead for that and he announced the schedule for this minor release for January 24th, 17:00 UTC is the release party scheduled, and I&#8217;ll share the announcement post in the show notes where he also listed the tickets, the bug fixes that are solved for this final release is also maintenance release, so it&#8217;s automatically updated. So watch out next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 17.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to Gutenberg 17.5, the latest Gutenberg release. There&#8217;s not a whole lot of in there, but there&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; There are big topics in there, but not many specific things. So the continued work on the editor unification, meaning that the site editor and the post editor have the same features, the same panels, the same preferences, and can be reused. And so developers as well as users don&#8217;t have to learn two interfaces for almost the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: There&#8217;s some randomized quality of life changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. And then of course that&#8217;s related to the history of how Gutenberg progressed, the post editors from the phase one and the site editors from phase two, and now they&#8217;re making them being the same. Especially the unified distraction free preferences. I&#8217;m really glad that it comes to the site editor now. Also spotlight mode and the show breadcrumbs, broad cramps. Yeah, there&#8217;s some German kind of cohort going in there. Sometimes I have that. It wasn&#8217;t as prominent when I was living in the United States because I was talking English all day long, but now with the German interacting with Germans, sometimes my English kind of sucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: As long as you all still understand me, dear listeners, I&#8217;m not stopping with this episode with Gutenberg Changelog. There are some component updates and the font library updates that are going into 6.5 to get the final touches done. They had to refactor some of the rest API interactions for the font library, but that is well on the way for the editor or the block library. We have two changes that I want to point out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that in the post featured image block, there is now an attribute that you can set to use the first image that&#8217;s in post as a featured image. I think that&#8217;s a great enhancement. That&#8217;s a feature that was missing from the classic editor or from some of the themes because I was really missing that. Oh, I have pictures in there. So use one of those and sometimes that would work and then sometimes it wouldn&#8217;t work. But now having that as an attribute in the block is really cool. Is there a user interface for that or is it just for the template?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: As far as I know, it&#8217;s just for&#8230; Well, developers are advanced users. We have the user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Okay. And then the second one is the gallery block. Now, you can just do a random setting, order setting for the pictures in the gallery so you don&#8217;t have to fiddle around with the order and moving around and you just&#8230; It&#8217;s a toggle switch in the site editor, in the blog editor sidebar where you can just switch it on and off and it orders the picture at random. Pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It definitely streamlines your production time of things and you don&#8217;t have to spend an hour forming an opinion what order you want and then executing on that opinion. If you don&#8217;t have an opinion, that&#8217;s fine. Is there anything in there that you want to point out, Carolina?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: In the update or in the block library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The change log. The change log.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: There are many small permits. We have some exchanges for the pattern overrides, which is their partially synced pattern with a new name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Naming is so hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It is. It is so hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: We&#8217;ll see. Eventually we&#8217;ll see where it actually lands when we have to write a documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then once the documentation is written, it&#8217;s kind of set in stone because nobody knows when you rename things. There are so many people out there who still talk about full site editing in new posts in 2024. So not on the WordPress site, but people here write the portals and all that. The pattern overrides have a lot of expectations and I think the 6.5 first iteration will be very limited in features that I think for paragraphs, for heading and for images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It needs to be limited, I guess. Well, we need more time, but also it just makes it easier to test and to receive feedback for it and not as overwhelming hopefully for users to actually learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, good point. Good point. I like it. And of course the data views, there are a lot of people working on the data views and it&#8217;s still under experimental flag, but it&#8217;s coming a long way. It really has some great attention right now. You can use it on the one store feature is enabled in the experiments. You can use it on the patterns page. On the pages page it&#8217;s already by default available for templates. I think template parts are still under the experimental flag, but those things will all come out of experiments hopefully very soon. So we can all test everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: It&#8217;s moving very fast. It is still unclear what will actually be in 6.5. But we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think every release in the last so 16 point&#8230; This is 17.5. So 17.3, I think, had the first data views or 17.2 even. And every release had over 20 PRs kind of going in into that feature. So it&#8217;s really moving fast and it&#8217;s beautiful now. I really like it. There&#8217;s quite some excitement out there in the community as well for those who have looked at it. And if you have an opinion, dear listeners, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are two items in the documentation section. There&#8217;s a lot of changes in documentation, but two, I want to point out because it&#8217;s for beginners on the block development. There&#8217;s a new section in the quick starter guide. If you haven&#8217;t seen the quick start guide for block development, I only use it to talk about other things. So the quick start guide for block development walks you through a tutorial on grading a block for copyright, dynamic copyright year on your website and use that block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a developer just last week and the recording is up on YouTube where Nick Diego and Ryan Welcher go through that tutorial and show how this all meant to be. It&#8217;s one thing to read a tutorial and try to follow along yourself than to watch somebody else go through a tutorial and then follow along. It&#8217;s a much richer experience. And the documentation changes here are all about the local development environment. What are the tools that you can use for local development on your machine?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of them is WP-env, which is the built-in WordPress development based on Dhaka. There are actually, I don&#8217;t know if you use them already, efforts to make the WordPress playground a local development. You don&#8217;t need local development. You can use the WordPress playground for development and have code editor in there. So I&#8217;ve seen some great mockups from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I have not tried it yet. It&#8217;s on my very long to-do list because I&#8217;m absolutely curious about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. But the WP-env script also, you can call it together with a create block scaffolding and you have almost instantaneous a good block development environment set up. There were some changes to block.json as well as theme.json And documentation and that&#8217;s pretty much what I wanted to point out. Code quantity is all very technical and all the efforts to write all the end-to-end tests and playwright migrating fast. And to build tools have been updated to the latest things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Oh, here it was, yes. So that was a change log for 17.5. It was not a whole lot in there for a WebPress user. It&#8217;s more like the future of things. It&#8217;s really cool, but not for immediate use. But sometimes you have these releases where there&#8217;s some foundation work being done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: The releases are some frequency, yes. Sometimes there will be these kind of releases but with less new ready features and more work on what&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of what&#8217;s coming there is this active discussion. I mentioned it before. There is an effort on PR that reduce the specificity on the global styles, CNS by, I think it was Isabel, Brison tele machines. She&#8217;s working on that quite a bit. And there is a call for testing, especially for classic themes to see how impact that will have on your custom CSS or even on block themes because the high specificity makes you create workarounds on all the different places. And if it&#8217;s reduced, you&#8217;re losing your targets. So how much work would it take? I&#8217;ll share the related ticket in the show notes, but did you take a look at that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I have read it. I have planned, sets time away in my calendar to do some testing and this is where it would really help to know what specifically to test for, like having something to help us get started because it&#8217;s a bit wide right now. It&#8217;s just test if your sales is still correct. This is also where tool like visual regression testing would have really helped. But in the next couple of days, of course we are going to have a little bit more testing done. We&#8217;re going to have some more comments on these issues, tickets and narrow it down a little bit so that we can have tests in the instructions and test results presented there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Aaron Robishaw who&#8217;s also working on those, he did some explorations on the current approach to see&#8230; I think his summary also helps with figuring out as a theme developer, &#8220;Okay, where do I need to look in my theme to test this rate?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: That sounds good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I share both of them in the show notes of the show. And it seems that we are at the end of our show. Carolina, you made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: We made it. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We made it, yes. It&#8217;s an awesome show. You have some great discussions on block development and block themes, and contributions, and a call for contributors. So it&#8217;s a full rounded show. Is there anything, Carolina, that you want people to know that you didn&#8217;t get to mention before, while you have an audience and think about it, and you could also tell me where people that want to connect with you, where they find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: Well, you can find me on Twitter, @carolinapoena. You can message me there. If you go to <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">fullsiteediting.com</a>, in the footer is also actually a link to a Slack channel that you can join if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: And on the WordPress Slack, my nickname is Poena. Yeah, that&#8217;s the easiest way to reach me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark</em>: I think that we need to mention everything a little bit about, but to think about when you&#8217;re switching your website to a block theme or what we need help with in testing the upcoming release and what we need help with for the bundled themes that we need more contributors and we need more testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right then. Before we end the show, remind you, there&#8217;s these events out there February 7th, that phase three media library. February 8th is the intrinsic design hallway hangout. There will be developer hours in February. I don&#8217;t have a date yet, but keep up on the meetup extensibility issues. Triage meeting is January 23rd. And then there is a livestream on Twitch about reviewing Gutenberg 17.5. I&#8217;m going to watch it and see what Ryan Welcher is digging up from this change log that we might have missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listeners, thank you all for listening again, and if you have any news or questions, or suggestions, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Again, thank you, Carolina Nymark for being on the show and sharing all your wisdom here.

And the information provided in a forum can help customers resolve issues on their own —&nbsp;reducing customer service costs and improving satisfaction. But if you’re not careful, forum spam can detract from the entire experience for members and reflect poorly on your brand.</p>\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are tools you can use to stop forum spam. When you leverage this kind of software, your customers won’t have to sift through pesky fake comments and posts to find what they’re looking for. They won’t be directed off&#8209;site for malicious purposes, and you’ll be able to maintain a more professional&nbsp;environment.</p>\n\n<p>This guide will start by discussing forum spam and all its variations. Then, it will outline the negative effects of spam and why certain anti&#8209;spam techniques fail to block it. Finally, it will show you how <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">Akismet’s enterprise anti&#8209;spam services</a> can stop spam registrations on your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283701\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is forum&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Whether you run a small business or a global enterprise, creating a forum is an effective way to connect with your customers. They provide people with a space to discuss (and potentially resolve) their doubts and issues. And a forum can even lighten the load on your customer support team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The only problem is that forums can become a den for&nbsp;spammers.</p>\n\n<p>By definition, web spam is any sort of unwanted message shared with a large number of people online. This can appear in email inboxes, the comments section of a blog post or YouTube video, a contact form, and, of course, a&nbsp;forum.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1448\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/image-2.png\" alt=\"example of a spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283703\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, forum spam is generated by bots with a particular goal in mind. For instance, a forum spammer may want to promote a certain product to the members. This is usually quite obvious, as they clutter the forum with messages spouting the benefits of whatever they’re selling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other times, spam can be harder to spot. These cases can be even more dangerous, as instances can contain hidden links to malicious sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>There are several different types of forum spam, like content spam, profile spam, signature spam, and private messages. We’ll cover these later in the&nbsp;post.</p>\n\n<p>If a forum doesn’t have a moderator or anti&#8209;spam software in place, spam can get out of hand quickly. And even if it does have a moderator, sifting through huge volumes of spam can be a poor use of&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the motivations behind forum&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>You might be wondering why spam happens. Here are some common goals of&nbsp;spammers:</p>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Promote a product or service</strong>. Forum spammers tend to promote unsavory products and services like gambling sites or unregulated weight loss pills.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>Harvest personal data</strong>. Often, spam comments will contain links to malware. If a visitor clicks on the link, hackers may be able to gain access to their personal&nbsp;data.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Conduct a phishing scam</strong>: Malicious actors may try to lure unsuspecting victims into phishing scams by pretending to be legitimate companies. They may link to websites that look like a real corporation and then ask users to verify account information. However, that info is just sent to a&nbsp;cybercriminal.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Boost search engine rankings</strong>. If your domain has a decent amount of traffic, spammers may want to post links in your forum that point back to their website. This way, they can generate backlinks and trick Google into thinking they’ve been endorsed by your site. This could improve their rankings in search&nbsp;results.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>These are some of the most common motivations for posting forum spam. Unfortunately, spam is always evolving, so it’s important to be wary of any suspicious activity on your&nbsp;forum.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the main types of forum&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>To stop spam, you’ll need to understand its various formats. Here are the four most common types of&nbsp;spam:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Content&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n\n<p>Content spam refers to anything that’s off-topic or irrelevant to the page that it appears on. Forums are usually centered around a niche subject, so this type of spam should be easy to spot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content spam is usually employed to promote a product or service and can contain links to another website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Profile&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>To participate in an online forum, members will likely need to create a profile or an account. Forum spammers can use these profiles to spread spam without anyone&nbsp;noticing.</p>\n\n<p>A spam account can embed hidden links into its profile. The most common example is a link in the username. But spammers might also include a link in the bio section of the&nbsp;profile.</p>\n\n<p>Each time a forum spammer posts a message or someone views their profile, this link will be visible to members. But unless someone clicks on it, no one would know it’s&nbsp;there.</p>\n\n<p>This type of forum spam is commonly used in an attempt to trick search engines or promote a&nbsp;product.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Signature&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n\n<p>Signature spam is a type of profile spam. Instead of hiding links in usernames and profiles, spammers include them in their signatures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that they embed a link each time they comment or post. The rest of their comment might be completely legitimate —&nbsp;and thus their work is less likely to be detected. This is another way to manipulate search engines for higher rankings.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Private message&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>As the name suggests, private message spam is sent to members of a forum. Considering that these messages don’t impact search engine rankings, this type of spam almost always has an intention of direct harm to your forum&nbsp;members.</p>\n\n<p>With private messaging, forum spammers can promote products, harvest personal data through malware in links, or set up phishing scams. This can be particularly dangerous because moderators are unable to see or stop this spam. It’s up to forum members to flag&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the consequences of spam on a&nbsp;forum?</h2>\n\n\n<p>This section will discuss the consequences of spam on a forum. These apply to both enterprises and small businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. A degraded user&nbsp;experience</h3>\n\n<p>Online forums are intended to create a dedicated space on the internet for a specific community. Forum members can post questions and raise concerns, or simply start a conversation around a certain topic that they find interesting or&nbsp;important.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, online forums can provide additional value to customers in the form of educational content. But if a forum is cluttered with spam, its members will likely have a hard time sifting through its posts. It will be up to them to figure out which comments are genuine and which ones are&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<p>This will lead to a degraded user experience. It could even prompt members to abandon your&nbsp;forum.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Damaged forum&nbsp;reputation</h3>\n\n<p>If a forum becomes overrun by spam, most members will assume that there aren’t any moderators to manage it. They might also think that the business or enterprise behind the forum hasn’t invested in any security measures to prevent forum spam and protect&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<p>These perceptions can damage your reputation. Plus, it might prompt some people to look for other, more credible online&nbsp;communities.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. SEO&nbsp;implications</h3>\n\n<p>Search engine bots are always implementing new ways to spot untrustworthy web pages. This is because Google (and other search sites) want to provide internet users with the best experience&nbsp;possible.</p>\n\n\n<p>If your forum is littered with content that spammers are posting to manipulate their rankings, or links to malware and untrustworthy sites, there’s a good chance that search engines will catch on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since software like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Googlebot</a> can’t tell who is attempting to manipulate it, it could end up penalizing your forum, rather than the perpetrators using it to do harm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This means forum spammers can hurt your website’s search engine rankings while attempting to boost their own. Your web pages may be removed from search results until you can prove their legitimacy. This will involve removing spam links and asking Google to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/ask-google-to-recrawl\">recrawl your&nbsp;site</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Security threats like malware and phishing&nbsp;links</h3>\n\n<p>Some of the more nefarious types of spam include malware and phishing attempts. These can have serious consequences for your business and&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n\n<p>That’s because this type of spam puts sensitive data at risk. Spammers can gain access to personal information like names, email addresses, and phone numbers. As a result, affected individuals will receive spammy messages through email or SMS, or their data may be sold off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Time and resource&nbsp;wastage</h3>\n\n\n<p>When your forum is plagued with spam, you’ll end up wasting resources on eliminating it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you employ someone to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\">moderate and block spam comments</a> as part of their daily work routine, they may be spending too much time on these messages. That means less time to focus on more important tasks, like answering customer queries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, any spammer is consuming your website’s server resources. Depending on the level of spam you’re dealing with, this could result in lots of wasted server space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The costs associated with hosting for enterprise organizations can get out of hand quickly. Working with efficiency in mind and proactively protecting resources is important. And for small businesses with a modest hosting plan, large volumes of spam could even impact site&nbsp;performance.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common characteristics of spambot&nbsp;registrations</h2>\n\n<p>Having an understanding of the different types of forum spam can help you identify spam more easily. Still, it’s always better to stop spam before it can infiltrate your&nbsp;forum.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the common characteristics of spambot&nbsp;registrations:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Generic&nbsp;usernames</h3>\n\n\n<p>Spambots aren’t very creative. So, one way to spot them is by looking out for generic usernames.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>These include usernames like “lucky_guy” or “shy_gal”. Of course, spambots can also incorporate fake generic names into their&nbsp;handles.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Suspicious email&nbsp;domains</h3>\n\n\n<p>Some of the most common email domains are gmail.com, yahoo.com, and outlook.com. They are all associated with reputable email providers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A suspicious or unfamiliar email domain could indicate a forum spammer. Spam accounts are more likely to use these email providers as they may not meet the security requirements to create a legitimate address.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. IP addresses associated with&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>If you suspect that a forum spammer has infiltrated your online community, you can look into the IP address associated with that spam account. This can help you confirm or deny the legitimacy of the&nbsp;account.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to look at the server logs and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-block-a-specific-ip-address-from-a-wordpress-website/\">find the IP address</a> associated with the spammy comment. Note that you won’t be able to do this with private message spam, as you’ll need access to the comment or&nbsp;post.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1264\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/image-3.png\" alt=\"finding a spammy IP address\" class=\"wp-image-283704\" />\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common actions of forum&nbsp;spammers</h2>\n\n\n<p>This section will outline some of the most common actions by forum spammers. Hopefully, this will help you identify them more easily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Replying to old/inactive&nbsp;threads</h3>\n\n<p>If a forum spammer wants to utilize your website’s authority to boost their search engine rankings, they’ll often reply to old and inactive&nbsp;threads.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because older forum threads will have received more traffic and better rankings in search results. If your forum has been active for several years, these actions should be easy to&nbsp;spot.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Leaving minimal replies with links&nbsp;included</h3>\n\n\n<p>Since a spammer has no intention of actually contributing to your online community, they tend to leave short replies with a link included.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they may offer a brief comment, this is likely something generic that has been programmed into the spambot’s capabilities. For instance, you might get something like “great content!” or “love this!”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Placing a link and website description in their&nbsp;profile</h3>\n\n<p>Profile spam is very common on online forums. You’ll often see a spammer place a link and website description in their profile. In this scenario, the spammer is likely trying to promote a product or manipulate search&nbsp;engines.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Using misleading topic&nbsp;titles</h3>\n\n\n<p>If a member uses a topic title that seems relevant to the forum, but then talks about something different in the thread, this is a major red flag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Essentially, this type of spam is trying to lure members into clicking on a thread by suggesting that it will contain valuable information for them. Once they’ve clicked on the thread, forum members will likely find promotional or otherwise spammy&nbsp;content.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Posting off&#8209;topic&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Another clear giveaway is off&#8209;topic comments. Similar to misleading topic titles (but more blatant), off&#8209;topic comments are explicitly pushing the spammer&#8217;s agenda without even pretending to contribute to the&nbsp;forum.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Using a website name as their&nbsp;username</h3>\n\n<p>Many forum spammers use a website as their username. This could be a spammy marketing tactic, plain and simple. It could also include a link, which would have <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/eliminating-spam-is-good-seo/\">bigger implications for search engine&nbsp;optimization</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Posting in a different language than the&nbsp;topic</h3>\n\n<p>The great thing about the internet is that people have access to forums in almost every country and every language. People often tend to congregate on forums with like&#8209;minded individuals as well as those with similar backgrounds, so while it’s definitely not a guarantee, a new user that posts in a language rarely used by other members of the forum can signal that they’re not there for anything&nbsp;good.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common anti&#8209;spam techniques (and why they fail to&nbsp;impress)</h2>\n\n<p>Forum spam can be a serious problem, and common anti&#8209;spam techniques might not always be efficient in spotting it. This section will discuss some of the reasons why these approaches&nbsp;fail.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. CAPTCHAs&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n<p>One of the most common anti&#8209;spam methods involves CAPTCHAs. This is particularly common for online forms (like contact forms) and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-user-spam-registrations-in-wordpress/\">user registration&nbsp;forms</a>.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"423\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/image-4.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA where the user types two words\" class=\"wp-image-283705\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A CAPTCHA presents a challenge or puzzle that spambots should be unable to complete. The theory is that it will prevent them from submitting content, but CAPTCHAs have several limitations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>First of all, they’re not 100 percent effective, since <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">many bots can bypass CAPTCHAs</a>. Plus, they’re not the most accessible anti&#8209;spam tactic, as they can alienate people who have varying&nbsp;impairments.</p>\n\n\n<p>In the past, CAPTCHAs were pretty straightforward. For example, you would have had to interpret some blurry letters and numbers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>But CAPTCHAs have become more difficult, even for authentic users who are likely to become pretty frustrated after the first or second failed attempt. These real people might even end up abandoning your site&nbsp;altogether.</p>\n\n\n<p>Newer versions&nbsp;ask users to do things like “find all the images with stoplights.” But they’re just as annoying for humans and still not very effective against robots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even the latest option —&nbsp;reCAPTCHA v3 — seems like an improvement for users, since there’s no visible test required to gain access, but it comes with some serious downsides.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, it provides Google with a lot of data that many are concerned violates the privacy of users. It can deter good bots like search engine crawlers. Finally, and perhaps the most annoying, real users can be flagged as spam without any way to prove their legitimacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Question&#8209;based&nbsp;challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Question&#8209;based challenges are another common anti&#8209;spam tactic. Although they aren’t as ubiquitous as CAPTCHAs and reCAPTCHAs, they come with the same&nbsp;limitations.</p>\n\n<p>They can create an obstacle for individuals with different abilities. If they become frustrated enough, they could give up on the challenge. As a result, you could end up losing conversions (or, in this context, new forum&nbsp;members).</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Email verification&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Email verification is another popular way to prevent spambots from infiltrating websites. It’s a bit more user-friendly than a CAPTCHA, but still creates an additional step in the registration process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Since getting conversions is hard enough, this tactic isn’t ideal. You’ll want to avoid any friction and streamline the signup process as much as&nbsp;possible.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 tool to stop forum spam&nbsp;registrations</h2>\n\n\n<p>So how can you eliminate forum spam without deterring real users? This section will introduce you to an efficient anti-spam tool: Akismet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is an automated anti-spam tool that uses advanced AI technology to identify spam without any input from users.
